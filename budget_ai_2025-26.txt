Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26Building Australia's Future
Helping Australians now and a plan for the future
In a difficult global economic environment, the Australian economy has turned 
a corner. Growth is rebounding solidly, inflation has moderated substantially, 
unemployment remains low, real wages are growing again, and now interest 
rates have begun to fall. 
While Australia is not immune to global challenges and many Australians 
remain under pressure, including from the impact of natural disasters, the 
Australian economy is well placed to navigate volatile and uncertain global 
conditions.
The Government has overseen the largest nominal budget improvement in 
a parliamentary term. We have delivered the first back-to-back surpluses 
in nearly two decades, and almost halved the deficit in 2024–25. The 
Government's responsible economic and fiscal management has delivered a 
stronger budget position and lower debt which means lower interest costs. 
The Budget delivers on the Government's economic plan, which is focused on 
finishing the fight against inflation, rolling out responsible cost-of-living relief 
and building a stronger economy and stronger budget.
The Government is helping Australians now and building Australia's future by:
• Helping with the cost-of-living 
• Strengthening Medicare
• Making it easier to buy and rent a home
• Investing in every stage of education
• Building a stronger economy

Responsible economic management
The Government's responsible economic and fiscal management has 
delivered a stronger budget, with the first back-to-back surpluses in nearly two decades and smaller deficits and lower debt compared to the 2022 Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook (PEFO). 
The Budget position is cumulatively $207 billion better than PEFO over the seven 
years to 2028-29. The deficit in 2024–25 is almost half what was forecast at PEFO. The Budget is also stronger over the forward estimates than MYEFO and the deficit in 2025–26 is $42.1 billion, an improvement of $4.8 billion since MYEFO. 
Fiscal policy has worked with monetary policy to return inflation to the target 
band in the second half of 2024, and fiscal settings are consistent with inflation sustainably returning to the target band around the middle of this year. At the same time, unemployment has remained low.

management 
Delivering on our Economic and Fiscal Strategy
The Government’s record of finding savings, limiting spending growth, and 
banking the majority of tax receipt upgrades has delivered the largest nominal budget improvement in a parliamentary term. This has seen fiscal policy work with monetary policy to return inflation to the target band in the second half of 2024.
Since PEFO, the Government's responsible fiscal management has:
•Delivered back-to-back budget surpluses for the first time in nearly two
decades, and almost halved the budget deficit in 2024-25.
•Improved the underlying cash balance by a cumulative $207 billion over theseven years to 2028–29.
•Lowered the projected peak in gross debt as a share of GDP by 7.9percentage points from 44.9 per cent of GDP to 37.0 per cent of GDP. Grossdebt is lower in every year of the projection period.
•Avoided more than $60 billion in interest costs in the eleven years to2032–33 due to the stronger budget position.
•Found $94.1 billion in responsible savings and reprioritisations.
•Returned 69 per cent of tax upgrades to the budget over the seven years to2028–29.
•Restrained real payments growth to an estimated average of 1.7 per centper year over the seven years to 2028–29, around half the average of
3.2 per cent over the past 30 years.
•Addressed medium-term structural pressures on the budget includinginterest costs, aged care and the NDIS.
The Government is repairing the budget to rebuild the buffers required to address future challenges, while continuing to deliver the high-quality services Australians deserve.

Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26Global  economic outlook 
Heightened global uncertainty 
and subdued global growth
There is heightened uncertainty in the global economy. 
Escalating trade tensions risk hindering global growth by disrupting trade and investment flows and driving up costs for businesses and consumers. This comes on top of the volatility and uncertainty from two major global conflicts.
This volatility and uncertainty will weigh on the global 
outlook. The global economy is expected to grow by 3¼ per cent in each of the next three years. If realised, this would be the longest stretch of below-average growth since the early 1990s. Australia is not immune from these global pressures but is well placed to navigate them.  
Globally, inflation has moderated, but the fall in inflation 
appears to have stalled in many major economies. This has prompted some central banks to adopt a more cautious stance towards further monetary policy easing, which poses a downside risk to the global outlook. Inflation is expected to continue to moderate across major advanced economies in 2025, but more gradually. Outside of Australia, very few advanced economies have managed to reduce inflation while sustaining a robust labour market and recording continuing economic growth.

Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26Domestic  economic outlook
Strong economic foundations in 
uncertain  times
Despite difficult global conditions, the Australian economy 
has turned a corner and continues to outperform many advanced economies. Inflation has moderated to be back within the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) target band, the economy has created more than 1 million jobs since May 2022, unemployment remains low, growth has rebounded solidly, interest rates have started to come down and real wages and living standards are growing again. 
Inflation has moderated significantly from its peak. Headline 
inflation returned to the RBA's target band in the second half of last year and is now expected to be 2½ per cent across 2024–25. Inflation is expected to sustainably return to the RBA's target band around the middle of this year, earlier than expected at MYEFO.
The labour market has outperformed expectations. The 
unemployment rate has stayed low, the participation rate remains elevated and employment has grown by more than 1 million people since May 2022, with around 4 in 5 of those jobs in the private sector. The unemployment rate is now expected to peak at 4¼ per cent, a ¼ of a percentage point lower than MYEFO. Stronger wage growth and moderating inflation have continued to drive growth in real wages. Annual real wages are forecast to grow by ½ per cent in 2024–25, a ¼ of percentage point higher than MYEFO. 
The Australian economy is on track for a soft landing. The 
economy recorded a solid rebound in growth at the end of last year. This momentum is expected to continue, supported by stronger private demand, with growth forecast to pick up from 1½ per cent in 2024–25 to 2¼ per cent in 2025–26 and 2½ per cent in 2026–27.Real GDP growth

Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26New tax cuts for every 
Australian taxpayer
The Government will deliver more tax cuts to all Australian taxpayers, with 
additional tax cuts in 2026 and 2027. This tops up the first round of the Government’s tax cuts that have been rolling out since July 2024.
These new tax cuts are modest but will make a difference. The Government 
will deliver these new tax cuts over two years, which will help ensure fiscal settings remain consistent with inflation sustainably remaining in the Reserve 
Bank of Australia’s target  band.
• From 1 July 2026, the 16 per cent tax rate, which applies to taxable income 
between $18,201 and $45,000, will be reduced to 15  per cent.
• From 1 July 2027, this tax rate will be reduced further to 14  per cent.
Helping Australians keep more of what they  ea rn
The Government’s new tax cuts will put more money in people’s pockets.
A worker on average earnings will get a new tax cut of $268 in 2026-27 and 
$536 per year from 2027-28, compared to 2024-25 tax settings. 
Combined with the first round of tax cuts, they will receive a total tax cut of 
$1,922 in 2026-27 and $2,190 per year from 2027-28, compared to 2023-24 
tax se ttings. 
In 2027-28, the average combined annual tax cut across all taxpayers is expected to be $2,548, or around $50 per week.

Building a stronger economy
Inflation is lower, interest rates have started to come down and 
cost-of-living pressures are easing, but many Australians are still under pressure. The Government’s combined tax cuts allow people to keep more of what they earn, boosting nominal household disposable income by 1.9 per cent by 2027-28.
The Government’s combined tax cuts are also expected to 
support labour force participation, increasing total hours worked by about 1.3 million hours per week compared to 2023-24 tax settings, equivalent to more than 30,000 full time jobs. This increase is mostly driven by women, who are expected to increase their labour supply by 900,000 hours compared to 2023-24 tax settings. 
Increasing the Medicare levy low-income 
thresholds
The Government will increase the Medicare levy low-income 
thresholds by 4.7 per cent for singles, families, and seniors and pensioners from 1 July 2024. This means more than one million Australians on lower incomes will continue to be exempt from paying the Medicare levy or continue to pay a reduced levy rate.  Rory is a full-time nursing assistant 
earning $60,000 per year. Under 
the first round of tax cuts, Rory 
receives a tax cut of $1,179 in 2024-25 and 2025-26, compared to 2023-24 tax settings. When 
combined with the new tax cuts, 
this tax saving will grow to $1,715 in 2027-28. This means Rory will receive an extra tax cut of $536 
every year from 2027 -2 8, compared 
to 2024-25 tax settings.
Alex and Kate are married with 
two school-age children. Alex earns $70,000 and Kate earns 
$120,000 each year. As  a result of 
the Government’s new tax cuts, Alex and Kate will collectively pay 
$536 less tax in 2026-27, and $1,072 
less tax in 2027 -2 8, compared to 
2024-25 settings. Combined with the 
Government’s first round of tax cuts, 
Alex and Kate will collectively pay 
$5,180 less tax in 2027-28, compared to 2023-24 settings.

Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26More  energy bill relief
Extending energy bill relief to the end 
of the year
The Government is extending energy bill relief to the end 
of 2025 for every household and around one million small businesses. The Government will provide around $1.8 billion in additional payments on top of the nearly $5 billion of bill relief being delivered so far. Every household and around one million small businesses will receive two $75 rebates directly off their electricity bills through to 31 December 2025. 
Commonwealth and state energy bill relief has already 
helped to lessen electricity price increases, with prices dropping 25.2 per cent across 2024. The additional Commonwealth rebates are expected to maintain downward pressure on prices.
The Government's retail market reforms will also help energy 
customers access cheaper deals and could save households hundreds of dollars off their annual bill. These changes will make it easier for consumers to switch to a better deal, ensure people receive their entitled concessions and rebates, and prevent retailers from automatically rolling over contracts to higher-cost deals.

14 Helping with the cost-of-living
Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26Growing  wages 
Limiting non-compete clauses to boost 
wages and mobility
One in five workers are subject to non-compete clauses that 
restrict their ability to move to a new job and are significantly suppressing wages. The Government will ban these clauses for low- and middle-income employees, which is expected to boost wages as these workers are freed to move to more productive, higher-paying jobs.
Backing increases to minimum and 
award  wa ges 
The Government has backed wage growth for low-paid workers in each of the last three Annual Wage Reviews. Across these Reviews the National Minimum Wage increased by almost $7,500 per year, with record increases in 2022 
and 2 023.
Addressing minimum wages in female dominated industries is the next step in continuing to reduce the gender pay 
gap.  The Government legislated to make gender equality 
an objective the Fair Work Commission must consider and supports the Commission's Gender Undervaluation - Priority Awards Review.
Funding wage increases for aged care and 
child care workers
In this Budget, the Government continues to support the 
aged care workforce with an investment of $2.6 billion for further pay rises for aged care nurses from 1 March 2025. 
This brings the total investment into wage increases in the 
sector to a total of $17.7 billion.  
The Government is also investing $3.6 billion to support a 
historic wage increase for the early childhood education and care workforce. This is delivering a 10 per cent increase relative to modern award rates from December 2024 and will provide a further 5 per cent from December 2025.   National minimum wage

Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26Cutting  the cost 
of medicines
Cheaper medicines to get even cheaper
The Government is lowering the maximum cost of medicines 
on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for everyone with a Medicare card and no concession card. From 
1 January 2026, the maximum co-payment will be lowered 
from $31.60 to $25.00 per script — the lowest in 20 years — and remain frozen at $7.70 for pensioners. 4 out of 5 PBS medicines will become cheaper for general non-Safety Net patients, with larger savings for medicines eligible for a 60-day prescription. 
$1.8 billion is being invested to list new medicines on the 
PBS – including new oral contraceptives and treatments for endometriosis, lymphoma, menopause and treatment resistant major depression. Since 1 July 2022, the Government has approved 319 new or amended PBS listings. 
These measures are part of the Government's ongoing 
efforts to ease cost-of-living pressures and keep medicines affordable. Existing investments include the current freeze on the maximum PBS patient co-payment that began on 
1 January 2025, which will keep the cost of PBS scripts for 
concession card holders at just $7.70 for five years, and the 60-day prescriptions which save time and money for millions of Australians with an ongoing health condition. 
The Government’s cheaper medicines policies have already 
saved Australians almost $1.3 billion on the cost of medicines. 5 million

PBS medicine empagliflozin. She requires 1 tablet a day, which means filling up to 13 prescriptions per year. In 2025, Cate will pay $410.80 for her medication, without a concession card. When the maximum cost of a PBS prescription is cut to $25.00 on 1 January 2026, Cate will pay $325.00 for 13 prescriptions, saving her $85.80. Cate can also talk to her doctor or prescriber about accessing empagliflozin as a 60-day prescription, saving her another $150 a year. Every year approximately 1.75 million scripts of empagliflozin are provided to Australians through the PBS.Cutting  student debt
Making student loans fairer
The Government is making changes that will cut a combined 
$19 billion in student loan debt for 3 million Australians and will make the student loan repayment system fairer. 
The Government will reduce all outstanding Higher Education 
Loan Program (HELP) and other student debts by 20 per cent, subject to the passage of legislation. This will remove $16 billion from the student loan accounts of 3 million Australians. The 20 per cent reduction is in addition to the recent reform to make indexation arrangements fairer, limiting future indexation and retrospectively reducing the indexation applied in 2023 and 2024, which has already decreased student loan debt by $3 billion. 
The Government is reforming the student loan repayment 
system from 1 July this year, subject to the passage of legislation. The Government will also increase the amount that people can earn before they are required to start paying back their loans from $54,435 in 2024–25 to $67,000 in 2025–26. No one will pay more under the new system, and compulsory repayments will be lower for people earning under around $180,000 and above the current minimum threshold. 
These changes will deliver immediate cost-of-living relief for 
millions of Australians with student loan debts.

university two years ago. She earns $80,000 annually, and currently has a HELP debt of $35,000, after receiving the indexation credit in late 2024.
From 1 June 2025, her total HELP 
debt will be reduced by $7,000, reducing her HELP debt to $28,000 before annual  indexation is applied. 
Under the proposed marginal 
repayment system, Sachini's compulsory repayment in 2025-26 will be $1,950, which is $850 less than she would have repaid under the current system.
These changes are subject to the 
passage of legislation.

Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26A better deal for 
consumers
A fair go for families, farmers and remote 
communities
The Government is helping consumers get a fair go at the 
checkout. The Government is boosting funding to the ACCC by $38.8 million to crack down on misleading and deceptive pricing practices and unconscionable conduct in the supermarket and retail sector.
The Government is providing $2.9 million to support fresh 
produce suppliers to enforce their rights under the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct. The Government has made the code mandatory and introduced multi-million-dollar penalties for breaches of the code by supermarkets.
To make it easier to open new supermarkets, the Government 
has provided $240 million for states and territories to liberalise, simplify and standardise their commercial planning and zoning regulations and processes, as agreed under the revitalised National Competition Policy.
The Government is also reducing the costs of 30 essential 
products, such as milk, fruit, vegetables and nappies in stores in remote First Nations communities to help ease cost-of-living pressures and improve food security. 
Tackling excessive surcharges, unfair 
practices and scams 
The Government is addressing unfair excessive card 
surcharges to get a better deal for consumers at the checkout. The Government is prepared to ban debit card surcharges, subject to further work by the RBA and safeguards to ensure both small businesses and consumers can benefit from lower cost payments.
In addition, the Government will work with state and territory 
governments to introduce bans on Unfair Trading Practices and empower regulators to take action against businesses that fail to provide remedies for breaches of consumer guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law.
Funding of $6.7 million is being provided in 2025–26 to extend 
the operation of the National Anti-Scam Centre to continue protecting Australians from scam activity. This builds on the over $180 million the Government has invested since 2022–23 across a range of anti-scam initiatives, which has seen annual scam losses decrease by over $1 billion since 2022.$50

Providing a pathway for 
2,000 more doctors in the workforce each year by 2028 and 400 more postgraduate scholarships to upskill nurses and midwives.There have already been nearly 18,000 new medical practitioners in the last two financial years.One new doctor was added every hour last year.This historic investment means 18 million more services being bulk billed each year from 2028-29.9 out of 10 visits expected to be bulk billed by 2030.$859 million saved by patients each year by 2030. 
Around six million additional bulk billed GP visits since tripled bulk billing incentives were introduced in 2023.
New menopausal hormone therapies added to the PBS after more than 20 years, benefiting 150,000 women each year. 
Increased Medicare 
payments and more bulk billing for long-term contraceptives.New contraceptive pills added to the PBS after more than 30 years. The listing of Yaz® and Yasmin® will benefit around 50,000 women each year. The listing of Slinda® will benefit over 100,000 women each year.11 more endometriosis and pelvic pain clinics.

These will provide fully bulk billed urgent care to ease the pressure on our emergency departments.
22 Strengthening Medicare
Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26Making it cheaper and easier 
to see a doctor
Record investments in bulk billing
Medicare is the foundation of Australia’s primary healthcare 
system. In this Budget, the Government is making a record investment of $7.9 billion to provide more bulk billing so people can see a GP for free. This is the largest single investment in Medicare since its creation over 40 years ago.
Expanding Bulk Billing Incentives
The Government is expanding bulk billing incentive eligibility to cover all Australians from 1 November 2025. This means an additional 15 million individuals will be eligible when visiting their GP for the most common services.
This is an expansion of the existing bulk billing incentives, 
many of which were tripled in 2023 for Commonwealth concession card holders and people under 16. Over 9 out of 10 GP visits for these cohorts are now bulk billed, reflecting the success of this measure. 
Establishing the Bulk Billing Practice Incentive Program
The Government is also establishing the Bulk Billing Practice Incentive Program to incentivise general practices to become fully bulk billing practices. Practices will receive an additional 12.5 per cent loading payment on their Medicare rebates when they bulk bill all patients. Participating practices will be expected to advertise their bulk billing status so patients know they will pay no out-of-pocket costs.
Combined with expanded bulk billing incentives, this program 
is expected to boost the number of fully bulk billed practices to around 4,800 nationally by 2028–29.Emma and Ryan are in their 30s 
and have two children under five. The children see their GP for minor illnesses and vaccinations. The parents see their GP a few times a year, which has increased recently with a child bringing home more viruses and colds after starting pre-school. 
If their GP moves to full bulk billing 
under the Government's package, their out-of-pocket costs will be $0 - all of their GP visits will be free. This could save them up 
to $444  per year if they live in a 
regional location. 
Strengthening Medicare  23 
Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26Investing in Medicare Urgent Care 
Clinics, hospitals and workforce
Making healthcare more accessible
The Government is improving access to care by providing $644  million to 
establish a further 50 Medicare Urgent Care Clinics across the country, with 
new clinics in every state and territory. This builds on the success of 87  clinics 
already providing bulk billed urgent care, taking the total to 137  clinics 
nationwide.
There have been over 1.3 million visits to Medicare Urgent Care Clinics across 
Australia since they were established in June 2023. This has helped take pressure off hospital emergency departments, and allowed them to focus on more urgent and life-threatening conditions. 
More funding for public hospitals
To further invest in our world-class healthcare system, the Government has committed an additional $1.8 billion to fund public hospitals and health services in 2025–26. This additional funding will help to cut hospital waiting lists, reduce waiting times in emergency rooms, and manage ambulance ramping.
The Commonwealth contribution to state-run public hospitals will increase by 
12 per cent to reach a record $33.9 billion in 2025–26.
Boosting the primary care workforce
The Government is increasing the number of doctors, nurses and midwives.  
This significant investment will support more junior doctors training to be GPs 
than ever before in the nation’s history. With up to 400 new places, there will be more than 2,000 doctors entering GP training each year from 2028.  
The package includes salary incentives for junior doctors to specialise in 
general practice, and funding paid parental leave and study leave for 
trainee  GP s. 
The package provides 400 nursing and midwifery scholarships allowing training pathways for new nurse practitioners and endorsed midwifes.  4 in 5

Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26Better healthcare for women
More choice, lower costs, better health for women
The Government is improving the accessibility and affordability of health 
care for Australian women throughout the different stages of their lives with a $792.9 million package to deliver more choice, lower costs and better care. 
This package includes funding for 150 per cent larger Medicare rebates 
and more bulk billing for the insertion and removal of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), and enables these services to be delivered by nurse practitioners. It also includes funding to establish 8 new LARC Centres of Training Excellence, to ensure healthcare professionals are trained, skilled and confident when delivering these services.
The Government has listed a number of oral contraceptive pills on the PBS, 
the first in more than 30 years. Funding will also go towards two national trials to make it cheaper and easier for women to access oral contraceptives and treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections.
The Government is providing support for women experiencing menopause. The   
package includes a new Medicare rebate for menopause health assessments, the development of national clinical guidelines for treatment, funding to train health professionals and an awareness campaign. It also includes the first PBS listing for new menopausal hormone therapies in over 20 years, with around 150,000 women expected to save hundreds of dollars a year.
The Government is also supporting the roughly one in nine women who 
suffer from endometriosis. Funding will help deliver 11 new endometriosis and pelvic pain clinics, additional to the 22 clinics already established. These clinics' capabilities will also be expanded to provide specialist support for menopause. The Government is also listing a new endometriosis treatment on the PBS. Around 8,500 Australian women are expected to benefit from this listing each year, who without subsidy might pay more than $2,700 for a year of treatment.Up to

for A ustralians
An ambitious national plan for 1.2 million homes
The Government has a comprehensive plan to ease housing shortages and 
improve affordability. The National Housing Accord is central to this plan, bringing together all levels of government, industry and investors to unlock supply.
An ambitious national target of 1.2 million new, well-located homes over 
5 years is driving the investment and reforms needed to support housing 
supply. Nearly 45,000 new homes were completed in the first quarter of the 
Accord, with the number of new homes to accelerate as the Government's initiatives take effect.
Building more homes more quickly
The Government is supporting a pipeline of 55,000 social and affordable homes through initiatives like the Housing Australia Future Fund (HAFF) and the Social Housing Accelerator. Combined, Round 1 of the HAFF and Accord and Round 2 of the HAFF are expected to deliver approximately 18,000 social and affordable homes.  
The Government has committed $1.5 billion through the Housing Support 
Program to state, territory and local governments to fund projects to improve planning capability, deliver enabling infrastructure, such as roads, water and power, and build more social housing. With the Government also offering $3 billion in incentive payments under the New Homes Bonus, up to $4.5 billion in funding is committed for states and territories to address infrastructure backlogs and deliver new housing.  
In this Budget, the Government is investing $54 million to accelerate the 
uptake of modern methods of construction. The Government has also committed $120 million from the National Productivity Fund to incentivise states and territories to remove red tape preventing the uptake of modern methods of construction, which will help more homes be built faster. 
The Government is continuing to work with states and territories on the 
National Planning Reform Blueprint to build homes faster.

Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26Expanding Help to Buy
The Government is expanding the Help to Buy program 
to support Australians to buy homes with lower deposits and smaller mortgages. This Budget is committing around $800 million to lift the property price and income caps to make the scheme more accessible. Under the program, the Government will provide an equity contribution of up to 40 per cent to support eligible home buyers to purchase a home with a lower deposit and a smaller mortgage. Around 40,000 Australian households locked out of the market will be helped into home ownership.
Banning foreign buyers of established homes
The Government will ban foreign buyers from purchasing existing dwellings for two years from 1 April 2025 and will provide the ATO $5.7 million to enforce the ban. The Government will also provide $8.9 million to the ATO and Treasury to target land banking by foreign buyers and 
ensure vacant land in Australia is put to productive use within 
reasonable timeframes. Brett and Mei are first home buyers 
looking to purchase an established 
house on the Sunshine Coast for 
$800,000. With a $50,000 deposit, they apply for the Government’s Help to Buy shared equity scheme. 
After approaching a bank, they 
find they can afford a $510,000 home loan and obtain a $240,000 (30 per cent) Government equity 
contribution. Thanks to Help to 
Buy, Brett and Mei will save around $1,464 per month on their mortgage 
payments.

Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26Improving access to housing and homelessness services
The Government is providing $9.3 billion to states and territories to help 
combat homelessness, provide crisis support, and maintain and repair social housing. This includes the doubling of funding for homelessness services to around $400 million a year. This Budget also provides $6.2 million for homelessness research, advocacy and coordination. 
An additional $1 billion provided to the National Housing Infrastructure Facility 
(NHIF) is also being used to support crisis and transitional accommodation for women and children experiencing domestic violence and for youth experiencing, or at particular risk of, homelessness. 
Supporting renters
Continuing the Government's commitment to responsible cost-of-living relief, the Government has increased maximum rates of Commonwealth Rent Assistance by 45 per cent for around 1 million households. This is the first back-to-back increase in Commonwealth Rent Assistance in more than 30 years. The Government is also implementing A Better Deal for Renters to harmonise and strengthen renters' rights across Australia. This includes a framework on genuine reasonable grounds for eviction and moving towards limiting rental increases to once a year. 
The Government has also refined the Build to Rent tax concessions 
announced in the 2023-24 Budget to help increase rental housing supply, including the supply of affordable tenancies, and to provide greater security and stability for renters, including stable 5-year tenancies. Industry estimates show this will support the construction of around 80,000 new rental homes in Australia over the next decade, including 8,000 affordable homes. These measures will operate in addition to state and territory initiatives to support the Build to Rent sector.

Apprenticeship stream as part of the new Key Apprenticeship Program. From 1 July 2025, eligible apprentices in housing construction occupations will receive up to $10,000 in financial incentives over the course of their apprenticeships, encouraging more people into housing construction trades and providing apprentices with cost-of-living support. This will assist in addressing shortages in the sector and help ensure Australia has the workforce needed to deliver our ambitious target of building 1.2 million homes over the next 5 years.
Employers of apprentices in priority occupations may also 
be eligible for up to $5,000 as a Priority Hiring Incentive, which includes many occupations relevant to housing construction. These current settings for the Priority Hiring Incentive have been extended for an additional 6 months 
to 31 December  2025.Up to

Building a universal early childhood 
education and care system
The Government is committed to building a universal 
early childhood education and care system where every child is eligible for at least 3 days per week of subsidised early education and care and where child care is simple, affordable and accessible for every family.
Children's participation in quality early childhood education 
and care has important developmental, social, and educational benefits. It lays the foundation for children's lifelong development and learning, and supports long-term productivity by increasing educational attainment. Early childhood education and care is also a powerful lever for increasing parents' workforce participation by minimising career disruptions and enabling accumulation of work experience.
The Government is investing $5  billion towards building 
a universal early childhood education and care system. Investments include:
• $3.6 billion to lift the wages of early educators through the 
Worker Retention Payment, benefitting up to 200,000 early childhood educators and teachers. 
• $1.0 billion to establish the Building Early Education Fund 
to increase the supply of high-quality early childhood education and care places across Australia, especially in priority and under-served markets. This is expected to support 160 new or expanded early childhood education and care services in areas of need, including the outer suburbs and regional Australia, located on school sites where possible. 
• $426.6 million for the new 3 Day Guarantee, which replaces the Child Care Subsidy Activity Test to ensure families are eligible for at least 3 days a week of subsidised early childhood education and care. In its first full financial year, 
the 3  Day Guarantee is expected to result in 100,000 
families being eligible for additional hours of subsidised early childhood education and care. $5.0 billion
for universal early childhood education and care
Milana and Rohan are a couple with 
one child accessing early childhood education and care for 3 days (36 hours) per week, 50 weeks per year. Their combined family income is $90,000 per year. Milana works 
full-time and Rohan works 8  hours 
per w eek. 
Currently, they are eligible for 18 hours of subsidised care per week (36 hours per fortnight). From January 2026, they will be eligible 
for 36  hours of subsidised care per 
week (72  h ours per fortnight). Based 
on their provider charging them the average centre-based day care hourly fee, this saves them $230 per week of care ($11,400 per year).

A better and fairer education system
The 10-year Better and Fairer Schools Agreement will see the Commonwealth 
increase its school funding contribution to put every public school on a path to full funding under the Schooling Resource Standard.
The Agreement ties new Commonwealth Government funding for public 
schools to reforms to help lift education standards across the country. This 
includes mandating evidence -ba sed teaching practices including explicit 
teaching, Year 1 phonics and early years of schooling numeracy checks to identify students who need additional help, more individualised and intensive supports for students and more mental health support in schools.
In this Budget the Government is providing $407.5 million over four years from 
2025–26 (and $7.2 billion from 2029–30 to 2035–36) to jurisdictions that have signed Better and Fairer Schools Agreement (Full and Fair Funding 2025–2034) bilateral agreements. This is in addition to $4.8 billion already committed over 2024–25 to 2034–35.

The Government is delivering Free TAFE to drive better access to vocational 
training opportunities and to help to deliver on Australia’s skills needs. Between its commencement in January 2023 to September 2024, there were close to 600,000 Free TAFE enrolments in courses linked to key priority areas across the economy.
The Government is investing to make permanent 100,000 Free TAFE places

The Government is continuing to implement reforms in response to the 
Universities Accord. These changes will support universities and students and help meet the Government's target for 80 per cent of the working age population to have a tertiary qualification by 2050. 
The Government is providing an additional $2.5 billion over 11 years from 2024–25 
for investments in a new higher education funding system. This will provide more Commonwealth Supported Places and extra support for disadvantaged students while they are undertaking their degrees.
Supporting students and graduates
The Government will cut student debts by 20 per cent with effect before indexation is applied on 1 June 2025, wiping $16 billion from outstanding student loans. The Government is also making the student loan repayment system fairer by increasing the amount people can earn before they are required to start paying back their student loan, and reducing compulsory repayment rates.
These changes follow the Government's 2024–25 Budget initiative to make 
student loan indexation fairer and reduce the indexation applied in 2023 and 2024, which has already reduced student debt by $3 billion.
Combined, these reforms will cut around $19 billion in student debt for more

40 Supporting the recovery and  rebuild from  natural disasters
Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26Providing a lifeline to affected communities
Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred has impacted communities across 
southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales. This has curtailed economic activity, harmed industries, and damaged property. It is likely to have the most significant impact on Australia since the October 2022 floods. 
At one stage, around 5 million Australians were in harm’s 
way and almost 2 million homes at risk. At its worst, around 450,000 Australian homes and businesses were cut off from power. Already, over 74,000 insurance claims have been lodged.  
The Government is continuing to provide specific support 
for communities, states, and local governments that were severely impacted by ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred. The Government has: 
• activated the Disaster Recovery Allowance which provides up to 13 weeks of income support, and the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment which provides a one-off payment to those eligible 
• co-sponsored with the states $30 million to support council clean-up activities  
• co-funded state and council early recovery efforts, including road repair, re-opening damaged infrastructure, and assistance for impacted small businesses, primary producers and individuals
• provided one-off Business Continuity Payments of $10,000 to Child Care Subsidy approved services closed or partially closed for 8 days or more due to impacts of ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred.
The full fiscal cost is not yet known, but it will be substantial.
After ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred, the Government expects 
that total costs for national disaster support will continue to rise to at least $13.5 billion. To plan for these future costs the Government has provisioned $1.2 billion in the Contingency Reserve to help better respond to, and recover from, 
future  d isasters. Investing to respond, recover and rebuild
The Australian Government's crisis management arrangements and Disaster 
Response Plan provided a co-ordinated and proactive response and recovery to ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) activated the National Coordination Mechanism with states and industry to support disaster preparation, response and recovery efforts. 
Despite these efforts, ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred and the subsequent flooding 
have damaged infrastructure in south-east Queensland and north-east New South Wales, and caused disruption to supply chains, agricultural production, construction, retail and tourism activity.  
The loss of economic activity from the impacts of ex-Tropical Cyclone 
Alfred could be up to a ¼ of a percentage point of quarterly GDP growth. Rebuilding efforts and the replacement of damaged property that will need to be undertaken are expected to contribute positively to GDP in subsequent quarters.
Delays to construction activity and repair work may contribute to price 
pressures in south-east Queensland's already constrained construction sector. These pressures are expected to unwind over subsequent months.

Revitalising National Competition Policy
The Government’s productivity reform agenda has included abolishing around 
500 nuisance tariffs, boosting competition in the financial system, reforming skills, education and aged care, and modernising the energy grid.
In November 2024, Commonwealth, state and territory governments built on 
this, agreeing a 10-year reform plan underpinned by a $900 million National Productivity Fund. The Productivity Commission estimated a revitalised National Competition Policy could boost annual GDP by up to $45 billion – around $5,000 per household – and reduce prices by up to 1.5 percentage points in the long run.
The Government is already delivering on this, including by supporting modern 
methods of construction, which the Productivity Commission estimated could boost annual GDP by $5.7 billion. The next tranche of competition reforms includes reforming non-compete clauses and designing a national licensing scheme for electrical occupations.
Banning non-compete clauses for low- and middle-income workers
The Government will ban non-compete clauses for low- and middle-income workers. This will free many Australian workers to move to more productive, higher-paying jobs and start their own business. Research suggests the reforms could lift wages of affected workers by up to 4 per cent or $2,500 per year. The Productivity Commission has estimated this reform could increase annual GDP by $5 billion.
The Government will also close loopholes in competition law that allow 
businesses to make arrangements that cap workers’ pay and conditions without the knowledge and agreement of affected workers, or block staff from being hired by competitors.
Reforming occupational licensing
The Government will work with the states and territories, unions and employers, on a national occupational licence for electrical trades to allow electricians to move where they’re needed most. This could set a template for broader occupational licensing reform, which the Productivity Commission estimated could increase annual GDP by $10 billion.
The Government has also tasked the Productivity Commission to identify more 
opportunities to increase productivity, to build on these reforms and actions already underway.

Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26Supporting small businesses
Easing the pressure on small business
The Government is extending energy bill relief for six months to the end of 
2025. Around one million eligible small businesses will receive up to $150 in rebates directly off their bills. Over the last 3 budgets, energy bill relief has saved small businesses up to $800 on their energy bills.
The Energy Efficiency Grants for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises program 
is providing $56.7 million in grants of up to $25,000 to over 2,400 businesses, funding a range of energy upgrades, such as replacing inefficient appliances and improving heating systems.
The Government is supporting the hospitality sector and alcohol producers 
by pausing indexation on draught beer excise and excise equivalent customs duty rates and by increasing support available under the existing Excise remission scheme for manufacturers of alcoholic beverages and Wine Equalisation Tax Producer rebate, estimated to decrease receipts by 
$165.0  million over five years from 2024–25.  
In addition, the Government expects around 1.5 million sole traders to benefit from the Government’s tax cuts for every taxpayer.
Levelling the playing field
The Government will work with states and territories on extending Unfair Trading Practice protections to small businesses. Small businesses can have a power imbalance when dealing with large businesses, and the Government will consult on how introducing these protections can help level the playing field. 
To deliver a better deal for thousands of small businesses in the franchising 
sector, the Government is providing $7.1 million over two years to strengthen the ACCC’s enforcement of the Franchising Code. The Government will extend protections from Unfair Contract Terms and Unfair Trading Practices to businesses regulated by the Franchising Code, subject to consultation.
The Government expects Commonwealth Government Business Enterprises to 
reflect the Government's 20-day payment terms that apply to non-corporate Commonwealth entities for completed work by contractors and subcontractors.
Digital and cyber security supports
Since the 2023–24 Budget, the Government has committed more than 
$60 million to help small businesses uplift their digital and cyber security 
capabilities through the Digital Solutions program, Cyber Wardens program, Small Business Cyber Resilience Service and Cyber Health Check. Together, these programs help small businesses adopt digital tools and grasp the opportunities that going online offers, and prevent and bounce back from cyber attacks.

Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26Building a Future Made 
in Australia
Australia is facing an increasingly complex and uncertain strategic 
environment. This Budget builds on the Government's existing $22.7 billion Future Made in Australia agenda to position Australians to be the biggest beneficiaries from the global transformation to cleaner and cheaper energy and secure Australia's place in a changing global economic and strategic landscape. 
Cleaner, cheaper energy
Australia’s potential for abundant renewable energy is a powerful source of comparative advantage and security. The Government is unlocking $8 billion of additional investment in renewable energy and low emissions technologies through a $2 billion expansion of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. This is in addition to $36.9 million to enhance the use of existing grid infrastructure and a $10 million Accelerated Connections Fund to reduce grid bottlenecks.
Unlocking private investment in priority areas
The Government has legislated $13.7 billion in hydrogen and critical minerals production tax incentives and has allocated $1.5 billion in support for priority areas through the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund, including $750 million for green metals, $500 million for clean energy technology manufacturing capabilities and $250 million for low carbon liquid fuels.
Support for Green Metals
The Government is helping decarbonise heavy industries and building future competitiveness. The $2 billion Green Aluminium Production Credit will support Australian aluminium smelters to transition to renewable energy, and the 
$1 billion Green Iron Investment Fund will accelerate the development of this 
new industry.  
The Government is also backing in the future of steelmaking in Whyalla by 
working with the South Australian Government to provide immediate support for the Whyalla Steelworks, local business creditors and the longer-term transformation of the Steelworks.  
Front Door for Investors
The Government is establishing a new Front Door for investors with major transformational proposals to make it simpler to invest in Australia and attract more global and domestic capital. From September 2025, the Front Door will begin to act as a single entry point for investors, providing priority projects with coordinated facilitation services, guided by an Investor Council.
46 Building a stronger economy
Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26Supporting Australian businesses
This Budget provides $20 million to support Australian producers through 
the Buy Australian Campaign, aiming to encourage consumers to buy Australian-made products.
The Government has exceeded its SME procurement target of 35 per cent of 
contracts by value from SMEs, for contracts with a value of up to $20 million, through the success of recent initiatives such as the Buy Australian Plan. It will also drive industry investment and innovation in more sustainable goods and services by applying the Environmentally Sustainable Procurement Policy to a further $4.5 billion of public procurement.
The Government is also supporting businesses through its trade diversification 
agenda. This Budget provides $16 million for a new Australia-India Trade and Investment Accelerator Fund, which forms part of the Roadmap for Australia's Economic Engagement with India. This will provide even more support for Australian firms to seize new commercial opportunities in India.
Securing Australia’s place in the world
Australia’s economic and national security are increasingly intertwined as we grapple with global risks and the evolving security environment. The Government’s 2024 National Defence Strategy set in motion a transformation of the Australian Defence Force's capability, focus and structure. This is 
underpinned by the Government’s investment of $330 billion in  the Defence 
Integrated Investment Program out to 2033–34, which will mean that Defence funding will exceed 2.3 per cent of GDP by the early 2030s. This includes a $50.3 billion investment provided in the 2024–25 Budget.
The investment in Defence includes $159 billion in maritime capability over the 
decade which will support over 8,500  jobs by 2030. Additionally, over 20,000 
jobs over the next 30 years will be created to support the nuclear powered 
submarine program. 
Australia has already committed more than $1.3 billion in military assistance to 
Ukraine. This Budget includes further support for more equipment, as well as $36.0 million over five years from 2024-25 (and $7.8 million per year ongoing) for the Australian Embassy in Kyiv.
This Budget also includes an important $44.6 million initial investment in 
response to the 2024 Independent Intelligence Review.

Thriving cities, suburbs 
and regions
Delivering transport infrastructure
This Budget provides $17.1 billion over ten years for road and rail projects to 
improve the productivity and resilience, liveability and sustainability of our cities, regions and communities. This continues to refocus the Government's over $120 billion 10-year infrastructure investment pipeline on nationally significant projects.  
Completing the NBN
The Government is providing up to $3 billion in equity to complete the rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN) across Australia. This investment will provide access to faster and more reliable broadband services to a further 622,000 premises, with 54 per cent in regional Australia. Upgrades are expected to be completed by 2030. With this investment, alongside the Universal Outdoor Mobile Obligation – which establishes continent-wide SMS and basic voice service – Australians will be better connected, safer and more secure.
Keeping our regions connected
The Government is providing up to $130 million in secured loans to keep Rex Airlines operational during its extended voluntary administration to 30 June 2025, while a competitive sale process is held. This will help maintain critical aviation services for regional and remote communities.
Supporting regional banking
The Government has secured commitments from the major banks to continue operating over 800 of their branches in regional and remote Australia until at least 31 July 2027. The banking sector has also agreed to increase its investment in Australia Post's Bank@Post service, providing greater certainty and choice for bank customers in around 1,800 regional and remote communities. 
Protecting our environment
This Budget includes $262 million to protect more of Australia’s natural beauty for future generations. This will help meet the Government's commitment to conserve 30 per cent of Australia's landmass and marine areas by 2030. It will preserve Australia’s iconic bushland by working with farmers to create havens for endangered plants and animals and manage critical habitat on their land. 
It will also help eradicate feral animals and invasive species.

Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26Progressing  equality, 
supporting women
The Government continues to drive progress on gender 
equality and improve the lives of Australian women. The gender pay gap hit record lows in 2024 and women's workforce participation reached record highs in 2025. 
The Government is supporting landmark wage increases for 
aged care workers and early childhood educators, where most of the workforce are women. The Government has also legislated to make gender equality an objective of the Fair Work Act 2009 and supports Fair Work Commission processes which seek to remedy the potential undervaluation of work in female dominated industries.   
This Government is also investing in women's health to deliver 
more choice, lower costs and better care for women.   
Addressing the national crisis of 
gender-based violence
The Government is strengthening justice system responses to 
sexual violence and committing $21.4 million over three years from 2025–26 for immediate, targeted measures to improve victim and survivor engagement with the justice system and to inform a broader response to the ALRC Inquiry into Justice Responses to Sexual Violence. 
To further address family, domestic, and sexual violence in 
First Nations communities, the Government is providing $21.8 million over two years from 2025–26 to continue the delivery of prevention, early intervention and response services. 
Initiatives in this Budget bring the Government's investments 
to support women's safety and deliver the National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children 2022–32 to over $4 billion since the October 2022–23 Budget. This includes $534.5 million already provided to support the delivery of key National Cabinet priorities to end gender-based violence.
These measures build on the $3.9 billion National Access 
to Justice Partnership with states and territories to enhance access to legal services, including for people experiencing gender-based violence. This partnership is the Commonwealth’s largest investment in legal assistance, and will provide ongoing funding for essential frontline services including for the most vulnerable people in the Australian community.

52 Broadening opportunity and increasing equality
Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26Investing in First Nations 
communities
To support stronger outcomes for First Nations Australians, the Government 
is investing $1.3 billion over six years from 2024–25 in this Budget. This adds to previous investments to deliver services and infrastructure for First Nations Australians, including the Northern Territory remote housing agreement and 
the $707  million Remote Jobs and Economic Development Program. 
Supporting First Nations businesses and building  wealth
Building on the commitment to establish a First Nations Economic Partnership, the Government is increasing opportunities for First Nations businesses. The Government is investing $23.9 million over five years from 2024–25 to strengthen the Indigenous Procurement Policy, and $3.4 million over three 
years from 2025–26 to establish a place -ba sed business coaching and 
mentoring program for First Nations businesswomen and entrepreneurs.   
The Government is also boosting Indigenous Business Australia's Home Loan Capital Fund by $70.9 million over two years from 2025–26 to increase opportunities for First Nations Australians to buy their own home and build intergenerational wealth. 
Stronger First Nations outcomes
The Government will also provide $842.6 million over six years from 1 July 2025 towards Northern Territory Remote Aboriginal Investment, in partnership with the Northern Territory Government and the Aboriginal Peak Organisations Northern Territory. This will assist remote communities to access economic development and employment opportunities, and improve health, safety and education outcomes.
The Government is investing to support better life outcomes for First Nations 
Australians and close the gap. This includes investments to increase the availability of culturally safe and qualified mental health supports, and to build the First Nations health workforce. Funding is also being provided for health checks and upskilling local First Nations staff in remote stores to promote good nutrition.

Improving aged care support
The Government is providing $291.6 million in this Budget to continue delivering 
its historic aged care reforms and implementation of recommendations from the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety. These reforms are essential to ensure the viability and quality of aged care, and to support growing numbers of older Australians choosing to remain in their homes as they age, while making aged care spending more sustainable.
This Government has also invested a total of $17.7 billion to support award 
wage increases for aged care workers, including $2.6 billion in this Budget to deliver another pay rise for aged care nurses, supporting the aged care sector to deliver high quality care for older Australians.
Looking after our veterans
The Government has released its response to the Final Report of the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide, setting out a plan for real, meaningful and enduring reform to improve wellbeing for Defence Force personnel, veterans and families. 
This Government has provided over $1.1 billion in funding, including a further 
$47.6 million in this Budget, to the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) to ensure it continues to be appropriately resourced. Government investments in DVA have eliminated the backlog of veterans’ compensation and rehabilitation claims and resulted in $13.0 billion additional payments flowing to veterans.
This builds on the delivery of the Government's harmonised and simplified 
veterans' compensation and rehabilitation legislation, creating a simpler system so veterans and their families can more easily get the support they 
are entitled to.
Supporting people with disability
The Budget invests $423.8 million to support people with disability including $364.5 million to reform the information Linkages and Capacity Building program, providing general supports for people with disability and their families, carers and kin. These supports will complement additional foundational supports to be co-funded with states and territories. 
The Government is also providing $42.2  million to deliver the National Autism 
Strategy and $17.1 million to establish the Accessible Australia program to increase inclusion through more accessible public infrastructure. 
54 Broadening opportunity and increasing equality
Building Australia's Future   |   Budget 2025–26This funding builds on over $3 billion of investment by this 
Government to improve the lives and safety of people with disability in Australia.
The Government continues to improve the NDIS to deliver 
better outcomes and ensure every dollar allocated to NDIS participants reaches them and is spent in a meaningful way that makes a difference in their lives. These reforms will help safeguard participants and the sustainability of the NDIS, ensuring it can continue to support future generations of Australians. 
Strengthening the social safety net
The Government has supported millions of Australians through increases to key social security payments and expanded access to vulnerable groups. Through the 2023–24 and 2024–25 Budgets the Government provided an additional $11.5 billion investment in the social security system, including:
• $4.9 billion to increase working age and student payments and expand eligibility for the higher rate of JobSeeker Payment for older Australians and people with an assessed partial capacity to work of 0 to 14 hours a week.
• $4.6 billion to deliver back-to-back increases to the maximum rate of Commonwealth Rent Assistance.
• $1.9 billion to extend eligibility for Parenting Payment (Single) to support more single parents.
Investing to increase local opportunities
The Government is working with philanthropy and local communities to support Australians experiencing disadvantage. The Government is investing in social enterprises, including contributing $1.2 million to jointly launch the Social Enterprise Loan Fund that will create secure jobs underpinned by wraparound support for vulnerable cohorts. This builds on the first projects committed under the $100 million Commonwealth Outcomes Fund, which will deliver projects that create job pathways for people experiencing homelessness, young parents, and First Nations communities.  $100

Statement 1: Budget Overview  | Page 1 Statement 1 : 
Budget Overview  
Against a backdrop of heightened global uncertainty, t he Australian economy has turned a 
corner. Growth has rebounded  solidly , inflation has moderated substantially, the 
unemployment rate remains low, real wages ar e growing again and interest rates have 
begun to fall. While Australia has not been immune to global challenges and people are still 
under pressure, including from the impacts of ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred  and other severe 
weather events , the Australian economy is well  placed to navigate a volatile and uncertain 
economic environment.  
The underlying cash balance has improved by a cumulative $20 7 billion  over the seven  
years to 202 8–29, compared to the 2022 Pre -election Economic and Fiscal Outlook (PEFO). 
This is the largest nominal budget improvement in a parliamentary term. After delivering 
the first back -to-back surpluses in nearly two decades, the deficit in 2024 –25 is almost half 
what was forecast at PEFO. This  Budget  makes further progress , delivering improvements 
in the underlying cash balance in both 2025 –26 and 2026 –27, and cumul atively over the five 
years to 2028–29, compared to the 2024 –25 M id-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 
(MYEFO ). A deficit of $42.1  billion  is forecast in 2025 –26, an improvement of $4.8  billion . 
Together, t his responsible approach means that gross debt is $17 7 billion  lower in 2024 –25 
than forecast at the PEFO  and 4.9  percentage  points of GDP lower in 2032 –33. The se 
improvements since the PEFO are helping avoid more than $60 billion  in interest costs over 
the 11  years to 2032 –33. 
The Government ’s record of delivering budget improvements and limiting spending 
growth has helped ensure  a stronger fiscal outlook. The Government has delivered 
$94.1 billion  in savings and reprioritisations since the PEFO. Over the s even  years to 
2028–29, real payments growth is estimated to average 1. 7 per cent per year, around  half 
the 30 -year average. The Government has also returned 69 per cent of tax receipt upgrades 
to the budget since the PEFO. Structural reforms to the NDIS and aged care , and reduced 
interest costs , have made t he budget more sustainable over the medium term compared to 
the PEFO .  
The global economy is facing considerable uncertainty and growth is expected to remain 
subdued over the next three years . Escalating trade tensions  have significantly magnified 
uncertainty in the global economy  and volatility in global markets,  and could disrupt trade , 
investment, economic  activity  and push up prices . These risks  are further compounded by 
challenges in the Chinese economy, lingering inflationary pressures and uncertainties 
arising from conflicts  in the Middle East and Europe . 
Growth picked up in the Australian economy at the end of last year, supported by a 
recovery in private demand. The recovery is expected to continue with the economy 
forecast to grow by 1½ per cent in 2024 –25, 2¼  per cent in 2025 –26 and 2½  per cent in 
2026 –27. The improvement in growth is expected to be broad -based and supported by a 
gradual recovery in growth in private final demand over the forecast period.   
Page 2 | Statement 1: Budget Overview  Inflation is now expected to be 2½  per cent through the year to the June quarter  2025, 
¼ of a percentage point lower than the MYEFO  forecast . Excluding the temporary impact of 
energy rebates and fuel, inflation is expected to sustainably return to the Reserve  Bank of 
Australia ’s (RBA) target band around the middle of this year, which is around six months 
earlier than expected at MYEFO.  
The labour market has outperformed expectations . Since MYEFO, employment growth has 
been upgraded, the participation rate is expected to remain higher for longer  and the 
unemployment rate is now expected to peak at ¼ of a percentage point lower  at 
4¼ per cent.  
The Budget delivers on the Government ’s economic plan, which is focused on finishing the 
fight against inflation, rolling out responsible cost -of-living relief and building a stronger 
economy and stronger budget.  
This Budget help s Australians now and build s Australia ’s future by:  
• Delivering  responsible cost -of-living relief – new personal income tax cuts for every 
Australian taxpayer from 1 July 2026 on top of the first round of tax cuts that have been 
rolling out since 1 July 2024 , extending energy bill relief, getting wages moving again 
including by advocating for increases to award  wage s, banning  non-compete clauses for 
most workers  and funding pay rises for aged  care workers and early childhood 
educators, reducing the cost of medicines  even further  and helping consumers get a 
better deal .  
• Strengthening Medicare – making it easier  to see a doctor for free  by expanding 
eligibility for bulk billing incentives to cover all Australians, improving access by 
investing in hospitals and urgent care clinics, investing in women ’s health, and training 
more doctors and nurses.  
• Making it easier to buy and rent a home – building more homes with a national target 
of 1.2  million  over five years, investing  in social and affordable housing,  expanding the 
Help to Buy  scheme, supporting renters , and  investing in the construction  sector 
through support for modern methods of construction and apprentices.   
• Investing in every stage of education – laying  the foundations for universal early 
childhood education and care with a 3  Day Guarantee for subsidised care and building 
more child care centres, putting public schools on a path to full and fair funding,  
supporting students and graduates through debt relief and lower compulsory 
repayments, and delivering 100,000 Free TAFE places every year.  
• Building a stronger economy  – advancing the Government ’s productivity agenda 
including competition reforms, unlocking investment in areas like green metals and 
manufacturing  to build a future made in Australia , securing Australia’s place in the 
world, supporting our suburbs and regions by completing the NBN rollout, delivering 
vital infrastructure and safeguarding regional banking  and supporting small businesses .

Statement 1: Budget Overview  | Page 5  Statement 1: Budget Overview  
Economic and Fiscal  Outlook  
Against a difficult global economic backdrop, t he Australian economy has turned a corner. 
Inflation has moderated substantially, growth picked up at the end of last year, the 
unemployment rate remains at low levels, real wages are growing again, and interest rates 
have begun to fall.  While Australians are still under pressure from conditions at home and 
abroad, the Australian economy is well placed to navigate the se challenges in the period 
ahead .  
The global economic environment is facing considerable uncertainty and growth is 
expected to remain subdued over the next three years. Around three quarters of 
Organi sation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OEC D) nations have recorded 
a negative quarter of growth over the past 18  months. The escalation of trade tensions has 
magnified risks to the global outlook, as new trade barriers threaten to disrupt global trade, 
investment and economic  activity and push up pr ices.  
Natural disasters and weather events such as ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred have had an 
impact on people and communities across  north Queensland, Far North Queensland, 
southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales , which h as curtailed economic 
activity, harmed industries, and damaged homes and infrastructure . The direct loss of 
economic activity from ex -Tropical Cyclone Alfred could  temporarily lower quarterly 
growth by up to  ¼ of a percent age point. This reflects  disruptions to activity  in the 
agricultural, construction, retail , transport  and tourism industries . Subsequent  
reconstruction efforts are expected to add to real GDP growth in following quarters , 
although the magnitude and timing of the effect on activity is uncer tain.  
Despite severe weather at home and global uncertainty, the Australian economy is on track 
for a soft landing and has outperformed most other advanced economies. Australia has 
been able to record a substantial moderation in inflation while maintaining a low 
unemployment rate and continuous  growth, which is a significant achievement  given the 
experience of other advanced economies and previous inflationary episodes. With recent 
inflation outcomes being better than expected, unemployment and near -term inflatio n have 
been revised down.  
Inflation has moderated substantially across both headline and underlying measures. 
Headline inflation was 2.4  per cent over the year to the December quarter 2024, which is 
less than a third of the peak observed in 2022. Inflation is now expected to be 2½  per cent 
by the middle of this year, ¼ of a percentage point lower than forecast at MYEFO. 
Excluding  the impact of fuel and energy rebates, inflation is expected to sustainably be in 
the RBA ’s target band around the middle of 2025, earlier than the end of the year expected 
at MYEFO.    
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 6 | Statement 1: Budget Overview  
The labour market has outperformed expectations with the unemployment rate near 
historic lows, the participation rate elevated  and, since mid-2022, employment has grown 
by over one million  people with 80  per cent in private sector jobs.  The unemployment rate 
is forecast to gradually rise to reach a peak of 4¼  per cent, ¼ of a percentage point lower 
than forecast a t MYEFO. The strong labour market conditions and moderating  inflation 
have led to five consecutive quarters of annual real wage growth.  Annual rea l wages are 
forecast to grow by ½ per cent in 2024 –25, which is ¼ of a percentage point higher 
compared to MYEFO.  
Growth picked up at the end of last year and this momentum is expected to continue to 
improve with r eal GDP forecast to grow by 1½  per cent in 2024 –25, 2¼  per cent in 2025 –26 
and 2½  per cent in 2026 –27. The improvement in growth is expected to be broad -based and 
supported by a gradual recovery in growth in private final demand over the forecast 
period.  
The moderation in inflation, solid labour market outcomes and the Government ’s tax cuts  
mean real household  disposable income  per capita began to grow again in the second half 
of 2024.  The improvement in real incomes is expected to drive a gradual recovery in 
consumption and the broader economy.  
Public final demand has helped ensure the economy continued to grow . In the most recent 
quarter , state spending accounted entirely for new public demand growth, with the 
Commonwealth component falling. Public spending has focused on meeting growing 
demand for essential health  care, education and social services, as well as infrastructure 
and defence investment . Public final demand growth is forecast to moderate over the 
forecast period.

The underlying cash balance is better in every year of the forward estimates compared to 
the PEFO and by a cumulative $ 34.9 billion  over the f ive years to 202 8–29.  
After recording the first back -to-back surpluses in almost two decades and the largest 
nominal back -to-back surpluses on record, the deficit of $27. 6 billion  in 2024 –25 is almost 
half what was forecast  at the PEFO.   Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 1: Budget Overview  | Page 7 
A deficit of 1.5  per cent of GDP ($42. 1 billion ) is forecast in 2025 –26, an improvement of 
0.2 percentage points since MYEFO. Over the f ive years to 202 8–29, the underlying cash 
balance has improved since MYEFO.  
Gross debt as a share of the economy is expected to peak at 3 7.0 per cent of GDP in 
2029–30, 7.9 percentage points lower than the peak in the PEFO, before declining to 
31.9 per cent of GDP by 2035 –36.

Responsible economic and fiscal management  
The Government ’s responsible economic and fiscal management has eased cost -of-living 
pressures for  million s of Australians, delivered the largest nominal budget improvement in 
a parliamentary term and laid the foundations  for a stronger, more productive economy . 
Inflation has fallen substantially, unemployment remains low, over one million  additional 
people are employed  since May  2022, real wages are growing, the gender pay gap is near 
its narrowest on record, and interest rates have begun to fall . 
Fiscal policy has worked alongside monetary policy to return inflation to the target band in 
the second half of 2024, and fiscal settings are consistent with sustainably returning 
inflation to the target band around the middle of this year .  
The Government ’s fiscal discipline, including finding savings , limiting spending growth  
and banking tax upgrades  has delivered consecutive budget surpluses for the first time in 
nearly two decades and a significant improvement in the fiscal position compared to the 
PEFO . The budget has improved in every year over the forward estimates compared to the 
PEFO, and is cumulatively better over the forward estimates than the forecast at MYEFO.  
This has helped drive a reduction in Australia ’s gross debt level as a share of the economy 
compared to PEFO .  
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 8 | Statement 1: Budget Overview  
The Government continues to exercise spending restraint . Real payments growth is 
expected to average 1. 7 per cent per year o ver the seven  years to 202 8–29, almost half the 
30-year average of 3.2  per cent.  
Since coming to Government and over the forward estimates, 69 per cent of tax receipt 
upgrades have been returned to the budget. The upgrades returned since the PEFO have 
improved the underlying cash balance by a cumulative $ 249.6 billion  over the seven years 
to 202 8–29, avoiding around $ 111.6 billion  in interest payments over the 11 years to 
2032 –33.  
Since the PEFO, $ 94.1 billion  in savings  and reprioritisations have been identified up to 
2028–29. The Government has made significant structural spending improvement s, 
delivering on its commitment to repair the budget and redirect spending to target national 
priorities, including : 
• the Getting the NDIS Back on Track No. 1 Act  that progresses key Independent 
NDIS  Review recommendations to make the NDIS more sustainable, and delivering on 
National Cabinet ’s commitment to the NDIS Financial Sustainability Framework  
• delivering historic aged care reforms to ensure the viability and quality of aged care, by 
moderating growth in aged care spending while supporting growing numbers of older 
Australians to remain in their homes as they age   
• delivering more sustainable funding outcomes for defence projects, while delivering a 
generational investment in the Australian Defence Force ’s posture, capability and 
structure with $50.3  billion  in additional funding over the decade  
• reforming the Infrastructure Investment Program  to ensure a more integrated, strategic 
and sustainable approach to projects, while remaining committed to an over $120  billion  
10-year  infrastructure investment pipeline  
• improving tax integrity, modernising the tax system and avoiding public debt interest 
costs . 
Since MYEFO, the Government  has strengthen ed the fairness and sustainability of the tax 
system, including measures in this update that  will improve the budget by $1.8 billion  over 
five years . Initiatives  include funding for the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to extend 
and expand  tax compliance activities focused on domestic and multinational tax avoidance, 
the shadow economy  and the personal income tax system .  
Complementing tax compliance measures, the Government will also commit $156.7  million  
in program funding to support the Illicit Tobacco Compliance and Enforcement Package 
focused on sustained disruption of the illicit trade in tobacco and associated nicotine 
products . This builds on the $188.5  million  investment over four years from 2023 –24 for 
Australian Border Force to deliver a coordinated multi -agency, multi -jurisdictional 
compliance response to illicit tobacco trade.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 1: Budget Overview  | Page 9 
In this Budget,  $8.3 billion  of policy decisions were funded by provisions from previous 
updates.  In MYEFO and previous updates , the Government responsibly  provisioned  for 
anticipated future expenditure, including to strengthen Medicare , continue  energy bill 
relief  and extend  the National Health Reform Agreement.  
The Government has taken $ 51.1 billion  in unavoidable decisions over this parliamentary 
term to address urgent and unforeseen issues, guarantee the continuity of funding for the 
essential services that Australians rely on, and deal with legacy issues inherited from the 
previous government . Unavoidable decisions over this term of government  include:  
• maintaining and improving health, disability and aged care services  
• listing additional medicines on the Pharmaceuticals Benefits Scheme and treatments on 
the Medicare Benefits Schedule  
• clearing backlogs for government services including veterans ’ claims, Centrelink and 
Medicare payments, and reducing customer call wait times  
• improving Australia ’s disaster and  biosecurity preparedness and responsiveness . 
Box 1. 1: Supporting the recovery from ex -Tropical Cyclone Al fred and 
Far North Queensland  Floods  
Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred had significant impacts on communities and businesses 
in Queensland and northern New South Wales in early -2025. The subsequent 
flooding damaged  homes and  infrastructure and limited  the movement of people 
and goods in these regions . 
This came on top of floods in early 2025 that impacted communities in north and 
Far North Queensland and fires in Tasmania and Victoria over the summer . 
The direct loss of economic activity from ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred could 
temporarily lower growth by up to ¼  per cent of quarterly GDP . Retail trade, 
telecommunication , accommodation and food services industries were negatively 
affected due to power outages and stay at home advice. Activity in the construction 
and transport sectors was delayed due to heavy rainfall and floods. Output in the 
agricultural industry has been  affected by damage to farm infrastructure and crops 
including sugar cane, fruit and n uts.  
Rebuilding efforts and the replacement of damaged property is expected to  
contribute to GDP in subsequent quarters. But delays to construction activity and 
repairing damage to homes and infrastructure will also increase demand for 
construction labour and building materials.

Page 10 | Statement 1: Budget Overview  
Box 1.1: Supporting the recovery from ex -Tropical Cyclone Alfred and 
Far North Queensland Floods (continued)  
This may  contribute to price pressures , particularly  in south east Queensland , where 
the construction sector is having some difficulty finding suitable labour to meet 
elevated levels of demand . In line with previous natural disasters, these pressures 
are expected to unwind over subsequent quarters .  
The Government is continuing to provide support for severely affected 
communities, states and local governments  affected by severe weather events . 
To support people and communities in the path of disasters this summer, like 
ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred  and the floods in north and Far North Queensland, the 
Commonwealth has:  
• activated the Disaster Recovery Allowance which provides up to 13 weeks of 
income support, and the Australian  Government  Disaster Recovery Payment 
which provides a one -off payment to those eligible  
• made further assistance available to individuals and small businesses under 
Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA) categories A and B  
• committed $136.3  million  since MYEFO under DRFA categories C and D to assist 
states to recover from disaster events in Queensland, NSW, Victoria and 
Tasmania , including initial clean up activities, recovery grants for primary 
producers, small business and not for profits, counter disaster operations, and 
environmental recovery.  
Australia has experienced several serious natural disasters in recent years. After 
ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred, the Government expects that total costs for national 
disaster support will continue to rise to at least $13.5  billion .  
Funding to support disaster recovery will continue to increase as the 
Commonwealth shares recovery costs with the states in response to recent events 
like the early  2025 north and Far North Queensland Tropical Low and ex-Tropical 
Cyclone Alfred. The Government has provisioned an additional  $1.2 billion  in the 
Contingency Reserve to fund these future costs.  
Climate change is causing more frequent and extreme weather events, with 
compounding and increasing effects on our economy, security and trade. To help 
strengthen our resilience and preparedness, the Government is developing a 
comprehensive National Climat e Risk Assessment and National Adaptation Plan to 
analyse climate risks and guide action. New climate disclosure rules now require 
large businesses to report on material risks to their operations, which will enable the 
private sector to make more resilient  investments and reduce the costs of future 
disasters .

Budget Priorities  
Delivering  responsible cost -of-living relief  
The Government ’s economic plan has been focused on providing responsible cost-of-living 
relief and help ing Australians earn more and keep more of what they earn . Key initiatives 
over this term of government include tax cuts for every Australian  taxpayer, energy bill 
relief  for every household , getting wages moving including through backing increases  to 
award wage s, ending non -com pete clauses for most workers,  funding wage increases for 
aged care workers and early childhood educators, cutting the cost of med icines  and 
supporting a better deal for consumers.  
New tax cuts for every Australian  taxpayer  
The Government will deliver new personal income tax cuts to every Australian taxpayer 
from 1 July 2026, adding to the first round of tax cuts that commenced on 1 July 2024. 
Under these changes:  
• the 16  per cent tax rate, which applies to taxable income between $18,201 and $45,000, 
will be reduced to 15  per cent from 1 July 2026; and  
• this tax rate will then be reduced further to 14  per cent from 1 July 2027.  
These new tax cuts are modest but will provide further meaningful cost -of-living relief and 
return bracket creep. They will also boost labour supply, particularly for women and lower 
income Australians (see Box 1.2 for further detail).  
A worker on average earnings ($79,000) will get a new tax cut of $268 in 2026 –27 and 
$536  per year from 2027 –28, compared to 2024 –25 tax settings. Combined with the first 
round of tax cuts commencing in 2024 –25, they will receive a total tax cut of $1,922 in 
2026 –27 and $2,190 per year from 2027 –28, compared to 2023 –24 tax settings. The average 
annual tax cut across all taxpayers is expected to be $2,548 in 2027 –28, or around 
$50 per week, compared with 2023 –24 settings.  
The new tax cuts are estimated to decrease receipts by $17.1  billion  over the 5 years from 
2024 –25. These tax cuts have been designed to help ensure fiscal settings remain consistent 
with inflation sustainably returning to the Reserve Bank of Australia’s target band around 
the middle of this year.  
The Government’s first round of tax cuts is already flowing to Australian taxpayers, with 
more than 14  million  taxpayers estimated to have benefitted from the tax cuts since 
July 2024 . This includes around 3  million  lower income taxpayers with taxable income of 
$45,000 or less, who would not have received any support previously.  
The Government will also increase the Medicare levy low -income thresholds by 4.7  per cent 
for singles, families, and seniors and pensioners from 1 July 2024. This means more than 
one million  Australians on lower incomes will continue to be exempt from the Medicare 
levy or continue to pay a reduced levy rate. This measure is estimated to decrease receipts 
by $648.0  million  over the 5 years from 2024 –25.  
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 12 | Statement 1: Budget Overview  
Box 1.2: New tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer  
The Government will deliver new tax cuts to every Australian taxpayer from 
1 July 2026, adding to the first round of tax cuts already rolling out. The new tax cuts 
are modest but will provide further meaningful cost -of-living relief, return bracket 
creep, enhance incentives to work, boost labour supply and support the private 
sector recovery.  
The Government will cut the first marginal tax rate from 16 to 14  per cent over two 
years from 1 July 2026, bringing this rate to its lowest level in over 50  years. The new 
tax cuts have been designed to ensure fiscal settings remain consistent with inflation 
sustainably returning to the Reserve Bank of Australia’s target band t his year.  
A worker on average earnings ($79,000) will get a new tax cut of $268 in 2026 –27 and 
$536  per year from 2027 –28, compared to 2024 –25 tax settings. Combined with the 
first round of tax cuts commencing in 2024 –25, they will receive a total tax cut of 
$1,922 in 2026 –27 and $2,190 per year from 2027 –28, compared to 2023 –24 tax 
settings. The average annual tax cut across all taxpayers is expected to be $2,548 in 
2027 –28, or around $50  per week, compared with 2023 –24 settings.

The tax cuts return bracket creep by lowering average tax rates for all taxpayers, 
especially for low - and middle -income earners. The average tax rate for a worker on 
average earnings is not expected to exceed 2023 –24 levels until 2031 –32 – two years 
later  than under current settings (Chart 1. 1).

Box 1.2: New tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer (continued)  
The Government’s tax cuts will support the economic recovery and businesses, and 
boost labour supply. Total tax cuts provided since 2024 are estimated to increase 
nominal household disposable income by 1.9  per cent by 2027 –28, compared with 
2023 –24 tax settings, contributing to the expected gradual recovery in private sector 
demand over the next few years.  
In addition, the new tax cuts will further improve incentives to work, especially for 
low-income and part -time workers who are predominantly women. The 
Government’s combined tax cuts are expected to increase total hours worked by 
about 1.3  million  hours per week compared to 2023 –24 tax settings (Chart 1. 2), 
equivalent to more than 30,000 full time jobs. This increase is driven mostly by 
women, who are expected to increase their labour supply by 900,000 hours per week 
compared to 2023 –24 tax settings.

Box 1.2: New tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer (continued)  
The Government’s tax cuts complement other Government reforms to support 
participation. When combined with the Government’s Cheaper Child Care policy, 
the tax cuts can significantly increase the financial reward from working additional 
days – especially for secondary earners. For example, a secondary earner with a 
full-time equ ivalent annual income of $60,000, a partner earning $80,000 per year 
and a two -year -old child will receive a $5,720 boost to their disposable income if the 
secondary earner chooses to work three days a week rather than two (from 2027 –28) 
– $1,515 more than  without the Government’s policy changes (Chart 1. 3).

Note:  Secondary earner has a full -time equivalent annual income of $60,000, a partner earning 
$80,000 per year and a two -year-old child. Benefit is for each additional day of work for the 
secondary earner and does not include the additional income earned, or the value of the 
tax cuts for the primary earner. The tax benefit is calculated relative to 2023 –24 tax 
settings. The two -year-old child is assumed to attend long day care for 10 hours per day 
on the same days worked by the secondary earner, for 50 week s per year, at the average 
hourly rate. Disposable income/take -home pay is the income available to the individual 
after accounting for Family Tax Benefit, tax payable and net childcare costs.

More help with energy bills  
Additional energy bill relief  to reduce  cost-of-living pressures  
The Government  is committing an extra  $1.8 billion  to extend energy bill relief to the 
end of the 2025 calendar year. Over ten million  household s and  one million  eligible 
small  businesses will receive two additional quarterly $75 rebates , extending support 
throughout  2025 .  
These rebates are on top of around  $5 billion  in rebates being applied to the electricity bills 
of households and small businesses  through the program over 2023 –24 and 2024 –25. 
Energy bill relief  being  delivered by the Commonwealth in 2024 –25 will take $ 300 off 
household electricity bills nationally, including another  $75 rebate still to be applied to bills 
from 1  April  2025 . Commonwealth and state government rebates have contributed to large 
declines in electricity bills  over the past year , with prices falling 25.2  per cent through the 
year to the December quarter 2024 , directly reducing  inflation by 0.6 of  a percentage point.  
Protecting consumers in the  energy  market  
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ’s (ACCC) Inquiry into the 
National Electricity Market will be extended for 12 months, helping to ensure households 
and small businesses are getting a fair deal from their energy retailers . This builds on 
reforms underway  to make it easier for  consumers to get onto the cheapest energy plans, 
including making it easier to switch to better deals, increasing support for those in 
hardship and delivering more protections for consumers . Reforms delivered will help 
consumers save hundreds of dollars in annual energy bill costs by helping th em to switch 
to the best deals available.  
Getting wages moving  
Backing increases to minimum and award wages  
The Government has advocated for wage growth for low -paid workers in each of the last 
three Annual Wage Reviews . Across the three Annual Wage Review decisions since 2022 , 
the National Minimum Wage has increased by $143.30  per week and by $7,451.60  per year, 
with record increases in 2022 and 2023.  
The Government legislated to make gender equ ality an objective of the Fair Work Act 2009  
and supports the Fair Work Commission ’s Gender Undervaluation  – Priority Awards 
Review, which seeks to remedy potential historical undervaluation in awards used in 
priority female -dominated industries.   
Funding wage increases for aged care workers  and early childhood educators  
Paid care work is dominated by women and has historically been lower paid and insecure . 
In recent years the Government has taken significant action to support strong wage growth 
for care and support economy workers . This  includ es investing $3.6  billion  to support a pay 
rise for the early childhood education and care workforce and $17.7  billion  for the aged care 
workforce  following the Fair Work Commission Aged Care Work Value Case decisions ,  
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 16 | Statement 1: Budget Overview  
including an additional $2.6 billion  to support further wage increases for aged care nurses 
from 1  March  2025.  
These increases particularly benefit women, who make up around 92  per cent of the early 
childhood education and care workforce and 86  per cent of the aged care workforce .  
Cheaper medicines  
The Government will be making medicines even  cheaper for Australians by decreasing the 
maximum general co-payment under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) from 
$31.60 to $25.00  from 1 January  2026 . By further  reducing the maximum co -payment , more 
than five million  Australians are expected to cumulatively save  more than  $200 million  
each year in out -of-pocket costs. This is in addition to the almost 300  medicines now 
available as part of the Government ’s expansion of maximum dispensing quantities  
through 60-day prescriptions .  
To further  improve access and affordability of medicines the Government is also providing 
$1.8 billion  for new and amended listings on the PBS, Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits 
Scheme, Stoma Appliance Scheme and Take Home Naloxone program . This includes  new 
oral contraceptives and treatments for endometriosis, relapsed or refractory diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma, menopause and treatment -resistant major depression.  
A fair go for consumers  
Helping consumers get a better deal  
The Government has provided $38.8  million  to the ACCC to boost its capability to make 
sure consumers get a fair go . This included funding for the ACCC to increase investigation 
and enforcement activity on harmful activity in the supermarket and retail sectors.  
In MYEFO, the Government committed to streamline commercial planning and zoning 
under the revitalised National Competition Policy (NCP), backed by a $900  million  
National Productivity Fund . The reform will improve competition, create new 
opportunities for business entry and growth and help to lower prices faced by consumers.  
The Government is also providing relief to reduce the costs of 30 essential products, such as 
milk, vegetables and nappies , in more than 76 remote stores in First Nations communities 
across Australia to help ease cost -of-living pressures and improve food security.  
Tackling excessive surcharges  
The Government is tackling unfair excessive card surcharges to help consumers  get a better 
deal at the checkout . The Government is providing funding for the ACCC to improve 
compliance with the current legislative ban on excessive card surcharges, by increasing 
monitoring activity and developing a campaign to increase awareness and understanding 
of surcharging.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 1: Budget Overview  | Page 17 
The Government is prepared  to ban debit card surcharges, subject to safeguards and 
further work by the RBA  to ensure both small businesses and consumers can benefit from 
lower cost payments . While the RBA completes its important work, the ATO  and Services 
Australia stopped passing on surcharges on debit card payments from 1  January  2025 .  
Targeting unfair trading  
The Government will work with state and territory governments to introduce proposed 
bans on Unfair Trading Practices, including subscription traps . The Government  will also 
empower regulators to issue infringement notices or pursue penalties when businesses fail 
to provide remedies for breaches of the Consumer Guarantee and Supplier Indemnification 
provisions of the Australian Consumer Law.   
Strengthening Medicare  
The Government is commit ted to ensuring that every Australian has access to high -quality 
health  care and is delivering record investments to build a stronger Medicare. More than 
$23.5 billion  has been invested in Strengthening Medicare since the 2022 –23 October  Budget 
– including recent measures to expand bulk billing, increase access to urgent care to ease 
pressure on public hospitals, improve choice for women and grow the health workforce. 
These investments will help make  health care more accessible and a ffordable for all 
Australians.  
Expanding bulk billing in every community  and investing in our workforce  
The Government is investing $8.5  billion  over five years from 2024 –25 to provide new and 
expanded incentives to further boost the rate of bulk billing , alongside new investments to 
train and grow our health workforce.  
Bulk billing incentives will be expanded to cover all Australians  for the first time . From 
1 November 2025  an additional 15  million  individuals will be eligible . 
On top of the expanded bulk billing incentives, the Government will provide an incentive 
payment to practices who choose to fully bulk bill. The Bulk Billing Practice Incentive 
Program is expected to raise the total number of fully bulk billing practices Australia -wide 
to around 4,800  by 2028 –29, further increasing access to free general practitioner (GP)  care 
for patients.  
By 203 0, these measures  are expected to result in nine  out of ten GP visits being bulk billed 
and an additional 18  million  services being bulk billed each year. This measure builds on 
the $3.5  billion  previously invested as part of the 2023 –24 Budget, which tripled the bulk 
billing incentive for a range of consultation items available for Commonwealth concession 
card holders and patients under 16  years of age.  
This package also includes investments to deliver more Australian doctors and nurses. 
This  includes through additional GP training places, salary incentives for junior doctors to 
specialise in general practice, and funding for paid parental leave and study leave for 
trainee GPs to address the differences in pay and leave entitlements which GP trainees face.  
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 18 | Statement 1: Budget Overview  
Through this package, an additional 1,300 doctors are expected to enter GP training over 
four years from 2026. By 2028, the Government will fund the training of 2,000 new GP 
trainees per year. This  package will also deliver more scholarships for nurses and midwives 
to undertake postgraduate study to extend their skills and qualifications, and attain 
endorsement as a nurse practitioner or endorsed midwife.  
The Government is also ensuring the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS)  is up to date with 
the latest clinical standards, investing  $256.2  million  over  four years from 2025 –26 to 
introduce new and amend existing items  on the MBS. This includes new items  to treat 
severe speech and language disorders, help manage advanced neuroendocrine tumours, 
and support telehealth services with consultant physicians.  
Improving access to urgent and hospital care  
The Government is providing  additional funding to increase access to urgent care and 
public hospitals to help ensure health care is accessible when Australians need it most.   
The Government will provide $ 657.9  million  over three years from 2025 –26 to expand and 
support the Medicare Urgent Care Clinics Program. Funding will  establish a further 
50 Medicare Urgent Care Clinics across the country , with more clinics in every state and 
territory , as well as extending the operations of some existing clinics . This will  support 
Australians to access urgent care and help to reduce pressure on hospital emergency 
departments . This expansion builds on the existing network of 87  Medicare U rgent Care 
Clinics, which have delivered over 1. 3 million  bulk  billed  visits across the country .  
Complementing the significant Strengthening Medicare investments and as part of a 1 -year 
extension of the 2020 –2025 Addendum to the National Health Reform Agreement, the 
Government is providing $1.8 billion  as an additional one ‑time fixed amount to fund 
hospital and health related services from 1  July 2025 , including  a one -off uplift to the 
Northern Territo ry. In 2025 –26, the total Commonwealth contribution to state -run hospitals 
will increase by 12  per cent to reach a record $33.9  billion . These investment s will help to 
cut waiting lists, reduce waiting times in emergency rooms, and manage ambulance 
ramping across our public hospitals.  
Investing in women ’s health  
Recognising the importance of women ’s health, the Government is providing  
$792.9  million  over five years from 202 4–25 to deliver more choice, lower costs and better 
health  care for women . This includes increased Medicare rebates and more bulk billing for 
long -acting reversible contraceptives and enabling these services to be delivered by nurse 
practitioners . It also includes funding to establish eight new Centres of Training Excellence, 
to ensure healthcare professionals are trained, skilled and confident when delivering these 
critical services.  
The Government has listed the oral contraceptive pills Yaz® and Yasmin® on the PBS . 
These are the first new oral contraceptive pills listed in more than 30 years . These listings 
are expected to benefit more than 50,000 women  each year , who would otherwise pay 
around $380 per year and will now pay $126.40 a year , or just $30.80 a year with a Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 1: Budget Overview  | Page 19 
concession card . The Government  is also list ing a progestogen  only  oral contraceptive  pill 
Slinda® , benefitting over 100,000 women who would otherwise pay more than $250  for a 
year of treatment.  Funding will also go towards two national trials to make it cheaper and 
easier for women with concession cards  to access oral contraceptives and treatment for 
uncomplicated urinary tract infections .  
The Government is also providing support for women experiencing menopause . The 
package includes a new Medicare rebate for menopause health assessments, the 
development of the first ever national clinical guidelines for menopause treatment, funding 
to train health professionals and a national awareness campaign . It also includes the first 
PBS listing for new menopausal hormone therapies in over 20  years, with around 
150,000  women expected to save hundreds of dollars a year from the listing of 
Prometrium®, Estrogel® and Estrogel Pro ®.  
The Government  is providing support for the roughly one in nine women who suffer from 
endometriosis. Funding in this Budget will support the  delivery of  11 new endometriosis 
and pelvic pain clinics and the expan sion of  their capabilities so that  all 33  clinics can 
provide specialist support for menopause . The Government is also listing the 
endometriosis treatment Ryeqo®  on the PBS . Around 8,500 Australian women are 
expected  to benefit from this listing each year, who without subsidy, might pay more than 
$2,700 for a year of treatment.   
Over 6,000 women per year are also expected to benefit from amendments to the PBS 
listing of  Pergoveris®  to double the maximum number of Pergoveris pens (four instead of 
two) per script. These changes will ensur e that  women undergoing IVF receive earlier and 
more affordable access to this form of fertility treatment, which would cost more than 
$3,500 per year without PBS subsidy . 
Digital mental health  
The Government is providing an additional  $46.0  million  to continue digital mental health 
services . Funding will be provided directly to nationally available  services , which are free 
or low -cost and d o not require a referral . Many  digital mental health services are tailored 
for cohorts at a higher risk of mental -ill health, including gender diverse individuals, 
children, young people, First Nations Australians and people from culturally and 
linguistically diverse  communities . 
Making it easier to buy and rent a home  
The Government has a  $33 billion  plan to build more homes  and make it easier for 
Australians to buy or rent a home .  
Ambitious national plan for 1.2  million  homes  
The Government has a comprehensive plan to ease housing shortages and improve 
affordability. The National Housing Accord (the Accord)  is central to this plan, bringing  
together all levels of government, industry and investors in a joint effort to deliver the new 
housing supply Australia needs . An ambitious target of 1.2  million  new, well -located  
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 20 | Statement 1: Budget Overview  
homes over five years is driving the needed investment and reforms to support housing 
supply. Nearly 45,000 new homes were completed in the first quarter of the Accord , with 
this number to increase as the Government ’s initiatives to incre ase the supply of labour to 
the residential construction sector, work with states to create a  more effici ent and 
respon sive plan ning and zoning system and incentivise the construction of more homes 
take effect.  
Building more homes  more quickly  
The Government is supporting 55,000 social and affordable homes over the next five years 
through initiatives like the Housing Australia  Future Fund  (HAFF) and the Social Housing 
Accelerator . Com bined, Round s 1 and 2 of the HAFF and Round 1 of the Accord are 
expec ted to deliver around 18,000 social and affordable homes .  
The Government has committed $1.5  billion  through the Housing Support Program to state 
and territory and local governments to fund projects to improve planning capability, 
deliver enabling infrastructure  such as roads, water and power, and to build more social 
housing. With the Government also offering $3  billion  in incentive payments under the 
New Homes Bonus, up to $4.5  billion  in funding is committed for states to address 
infrastructure backlogs and reduce barriers to new housing.  
In this Budget, the Government is investing $54  million  to accelerate the uptake of modern 
methods of construction. The Government has also committed $120  million  from the 
National Productivity Fund to incentivise states to remove red tape preventing the uptake 
of modern methods of construction, which will help more homes be built faster.  
The Government is also continuing to work with states on the National Planning Reform 
Blueprint  to build homes faster.  
Expanding Help to Buy  
The Government is expanding the Help to Buy scheme to support Australians to buy 
homes with lower deposits and smaller mortgages. This Budget is committing around 
$800  million  to lift the property price and income caps to make the scheme more accessible. 
Under the scheme, the Government will provide an equity contribution of up to 40  per cent 
to support eligible home buyers buy a home with a lower deposit  and smaller mortgage, 
helping around 40,000 Australian households locked out of the market into home 
ownership.   
Banning foreign buyers  of established homes  
Foreign buyers will be banned from purchasing existing dwellings for a 2 -year period from 
1 April  2025 . The Government is providing $5.7  million  to the ATO  to enforce the ban. The 
Government is also providing $8.9  million  to the ATO and Treasury to implement an audit 
program to target land banking by foreign buyers.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 1: Budget Overview  | Page 21 
Improving access to housing and homelessness services  
The Government is providing $9.3  billion  to states and territories to combat homelessness, 
provide crisis support and maintain social housing through the National Agreement on 
Social Housing and Homelessness. This in cludes the doubling of dedicated 
Commonwealth funding for homelessness services to around $400  million  per year , which 
states are required to match. This Budget also provides $6.2  million  for homelessness 
research, advocacy and coordination to improve outcomes for vulnerable Australians.  
An additional $1  billion  provided to the National Housing Infrastructure Facility is also 
being used to support crisis and transitional accommodation for women and children 
experiencing domestic violence, and for youth experiencing, or at particular risk of 
experiencing, homeless ness.  
Supporting renters  
Continuing the Government ’s commitment to responsible cost -of-living relief, the 
Government has delivered the first back -to-back increases to Commonwealth Rent 
Assistance in 30 years. Combined with indexation, the maximum rates of rent assistance are 
45 per cent higher since the Government came to office, benefitting around one million  
households.  
The Government is also implementing A Better Deal for Renters to harmonise and 
strengthen renters ’ rights across Australia. This includes a framework on genuine 
reasonable grounds for eviction and moving towards limiting rental increases to 
once  per year.  
The Government has implemented tax measures to support greater investment in 
build -to-rent developments and increase the supply of affordable tenancies. Industry 
estimates indicate these changes may support around 80,000 new long -term, stable and 
secure rental homes in Australia over the next decade.  
Boosting the construction workforce  
The Government will invest in the pipeline of construction workers by doubling the 
current  maximum incentive payments for  eligible  housing construction apprentices from 
$5,000  to $10,000 from 1  July 2025, supporting Australians through their training and 
boosting the construction workforce . To ensure that Australians have the skills they need, 
the Government has established Free TAFE . Between January  2023 and September  2024 , 
there have been close to 600,000  Free TAFE enrolments, with almost 40,000 of these in 
construction sector courses . The Government has now introduced legislation to make 
Free  TAFE permanent, funding 100,000 Free TAFE places annually from 1  January  2027.  
Investing in every stage of education  
The Government is investing in an education  system to drive future prosperity. 
Key priorities include providing greater access to and improving the affordability of 
high -quality early childhood education and care, putting  public schools  on a path to full  
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 22 | Statement 1: Budget Overview  
and fair funding , supporting students and graduates by making the student loan system 
fairer, and reforming our tertiary education system through Free TAFE and a new 
university funding model.  
Next steps in building a universal early childhood education and care system  
The Government is committed to building a universal early childhood education and care 
system where every child is guaranteed access to at least three days per week of quality 
early education and care, which is simple and affordable for every family .  
Key initiatives include Cheaper Child Care for over one million  families, funding to lift the 
wages of early educators, establishing the  Building Early Education Fund to build new 
child  care centres and drive supply of high quality care, and replacing the Child Care 
Subsidy activity test with a new 3  Day Guarantee.  
The changes were informed by the Productivity Commission ’s inquiry report A pathway to 
universal early childhood education and care  and the ACCC ’s 2023 Childcare Inquiry . These 
changes will improve the accessibility and affordability of early childhood education and 
care, including for the children who will benefit the most from it but are currently the least 
likely to attend.  
A better and fairer education system  
The Government is working towards putting all public schools in Australia on a path to full 
and fair funding to help create a better and fairer education system for all students.  
The Government will provide  additional schools  funding  to jurisdictions that have signed 
the Better and Fairer Schools Agreement (Full and Fair Funding 2025 –2034) bilateral 
agreements. The agreement sees the Commonwealth increase its share of the Schooling 
Resource Standard to 25  per cent by 2034 –35, putting schools on a path to full and fair 
funding.  
The agreement ties new funding to reforms to help lift education standards across the 
country. This includes mandating evidence -based teaching practices including explicit 
teaching, Year  1 phonics and early years of schooling numeracy checks to identify students 
who need additional help, more individualised and intensive supports for students and 
more mental health support in schools.  
Negotiations with jurisdictions that are yet to sign the bilateral agreement are continuing, 
with funding being held in the Contingency Reserve pending finalisation of negotiations.   
Support for students and graduates  
The Government is making changes that will reduce Higher Education Loan Program 
(HELP) and other student debts for more than three  million  Australians by around 
$19 billion  and is continuing to make the student loan system fairer .  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 1: Budget Overview  | Page 23 
The Government will reduce  outstanding student debts by 20  per cent, which will remove 
$16 billion  in debt , and will make  the repayment system fairer by moving to a marginal 
repayment system with a higher  minimum repayment threshold . These changes will 
deliver significant cost -of-living relief to Australians with student debt, allowing them to 
keep more of what they earn .  
The Government has already  legislated a cap on HELP indexation based on the lower of the 
Consumer Price Index or the Wage Price Index . The change was backdated to 1  June  2023, 
and has reduced  outstanding student debt by around $3  billion . 
Making Free TAFE permanent  
The Government is committed to creating a highly skilled and trained workforce to meet 
the skills needs of the future , and has set a target of 80  per cent of the working age 
population having a tertiary qualification by 2050 . Over the next decade, nine out of ten 
new jobs will require post -secondary qualifications and almost half will come through VET 
pathways.  
The Government has introduced legislation to make permanent  100,000 Free TAFE places 
every year from 1  January  2027 . Ongoing Free TAFE will ease cost -of-living pressures for 
students while supporting them to obtain secure employment . Between its commencement 
in January  2023 to September  2024, there were close to 600,000  Free  TAFE enrolments in 
courses linked to key priority areas across the economy.  
A new university funding system  
To help meet our 80  per cent tertiary attainment target, the Government is also supporting 
the sustainable growth of the university sector by implementing key recommendations of 
the Universities Accord, including establishing new university governance and funding 
mechanisms.  
The new university funding system will provide more university places and will support 
students from under -represented backgrounds to enrol in universities and complete their 
degrees . The Government ’s expansion of access to FEE -FREE Uni Ready Courses is also 
providing more students with a pathway to university . The Commonwealth Prac Payment, 
commencing 1  July 2025, will also alleviate the financial impact of being on placement for 
eligible students and support retention in courses related to sectors with sk ills shortages .  
The Government is establishing the Australian Tertiary Education Commission, which will 
provide advice on higher education pricing matters, tertiary sector harmonisation and 
sector performance to ensure that tertiary education remains strong and responsive  to 
Australia ’s future needs.  
Building a stronger economy  
The Government has an ambitious reform agenda to build a stronger, more productive and 
more resilient economy. This includes a strong focus on competition policy and unlocking 
investment in strategic areas as part of the Future Made in Australia agenda.  
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 24 | Statement 1: Budget Overview  
The Government is ensuring Australian workers are well -placed for the jobs of the future,  
supporting our thriving suburbs and regions and backing small business es.  
A more dynamic and productive economy  
Competition is an essential tool for reducing the cost  of living and boosting productivity . 
Commonwealth, state and territory governments have committed to  two new agreements 
to deliver a landmark 10 -year NCP  reform program.  
The first tranche of five priority Commonwealth and state -led reforms focus on easing 
cost-of-living pressures . This includes reforms to streamline commercial planning and 
zoning, level the playing  field for modern methods of construction, develop a broader right 
to repair, allow easier adoption of overseas standards and pave the way for a national 
worker screening check . The reforms are underpinned by the $900  million  National 
Productivity Fund to reward states and territories for agreed reforms that promote 
competition .  
The next tranche of reforms will include:  
• banning  non-compete clauses for low- and middle -income workers. This will free many 
Australian workers to move to more productive, higher -paying jobs and start their own 
business  
• working  with states and territories , employers and unions  through NCP to design a 
national licensing scheme for electrical  occupations .  
Banning non -competes for low and middle income workers  
Non -compete clauses  prevent or restrict  worker s from moving (or attempting to move) to a 
competing employer, or from starting or operating a competing business, with a specific 
geographic location and for a certain duration. They are often broad in scope  and 
significantly reduce worker  mobility, especially for lower -paid workers.  
The Government ’s Competition Review found compelling evidence that non -compete 
clauses are now a common and growing feature of Australia ’s labour market, and are 
suppressing the wages of many workers, including many lower -paid and vulnerable 
workers. The review found the clauses are often being used indiscriminately across income 
levels and occupations including for child  care workers, construction workers and 
hairdressers.  
The Government will ban  non-compete clauses that apply to workers earning less than the 
high -income threshold in the Fair Work Act (currently $175,000).  The Government will also 
close loopholes in competition law that currently allow businesses to:  
• Fix wages by making anti -competitive arrangements that cap workers ’ pay and 
conditions, without the knowledge and agreement of affected workers  
• Use ‘no-poach ’ agreements to block staff from being hired by competitors.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 1: Budget Overview  | Page 25 
The Government will consult on policy details, including exemptions, penalties, and 
transition arrangements  and will also consider and consult further on non -solicitation 
clauses for clients and co -workers and non -compete clauses for high -income workers.  
Box 1. 3: Benefits of the revitalised National Competition Policy  
The Commonwealth, state and territory treasurers are working to revitalise National 
Competition Policy (NCP). This includes an ambitious decade long reform program 
underpinned by the Government’s $900  million  National Productivity Fund.  
Modelling from the Productivity Commission’s National Competition Policy Study 
found a revitalised NCP could deliver an ongoing boost to annual GDP of up to 
$45 billion  and drive down prices, while supporting an efficient net zero 
transformation and the delivery of quality care services. These benefits are similar in 
scale to those of the NCP reforms of the 1990s, which brought a period of sustained 
economic growth that lifted incomes by $5,000 per household in today’s dollars.  
In November 2024 the Government agreed a first tranche of priority reforms focused 
on easing cost -of-living pressures and reducing regulatory burden. It is now adding 
reforms to non -competes and occupational licensing.   
Banning the unreasonable use of non -compete clauses could increase annual GDP by 
$5 billion  once the reforms take full effect. Around 3  million  Australian workers are 
now subject to these clauses, and they are increasingly common even in lower -wage 
areas like child care. This reform will free up many Australian workers to move to 
higher paying jobs and start their own businesses, allow growing bu sinesses to 
access talented workers, and boost wages and productivity across the economy. 
Research suggests the r eforms could lift wages by between 2 to 4  per cent or up to 
$2,500 per year for affected workers on median wages.  
Reforming occupational licen sing was also estimated to yield significant benefits, 
boosting annual GDP by up to $10  billion . The Government is committing in this 
Budget to work with the states and territories, unions and employers on a national 
occupational licence for the electrical trades. This will allow electricians to move to 
where they’re needed most, bringing significan t benefits for workers, business and 
consumers through improved labour mobility, reduced red tape and by easing 
cost-of-living pressu res.  
Other competition reforms  
From 1  January  2026, the Government will commence a new mandatory merger system to 
promote competition, protect consumers and provide greater certainty to businesses by 
streamlining the approvals process . The reforms will simplify and speed up the process for 
mergers, consistent with the national interest, and give the ACCC stronger powers to 
identify and scrutinise transactions that pose a risk to competition, consumers and the 
economy.   
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 26 | Statement 1: Budget Overview  
The reforms are part of the Government ’s productivity agenda, which includes  abolishing 
457 nuisance tariffs, boosting competition in the  financial system, reforming skills and 
education, establishing a comprehensive review of research and development , reforming 
the delivery of aged care and modernising the energy grid.  
Building a Future Made in Australia  
The Government ’s Future Made in Australia agenda is seizing the vast economic and 
industrial opportunities on offer from the transformation to cleaner and cheaper energy . 
The Government is progressing a range of reforms to secure Australia ’s place in a changing 
global economic and strategic landscape.  
The 2024 –25 Budget invested $22.7  billion  over a decade to bring new jobs and 
opportunities to communities in every part of Australia, including funding to better 
prioritise approval decisions, support for innovative technology and clean energy 
manufacturing and establishing a new Front Door for investors . 
Since  MYEFO, the Government has progressed a broad range of initiatives aligned with the 
Future Made in Australia agenda . This includes the passage of legislation supporting the 
hydrogen and critical minerals production tax incentives  and commi tting an additional 
$2 billion  to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to continue  mobilising critical private 
investment into renewable energy, energy efficiency and low emissions technologies .  
The Government has  also announced priority sector funding allocations from the  
$1.7 billion  Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund . This includes  $750  million  for green 
metals,  $500  million  for clean energy technology manufacturing capabilities including 
electrolysers, batteries and wind towers and $250  million  for low carbon liquid fuels .   
Front Door for investors  
The Government is establishing a new Front Door for investors with major 
transformation al proposals, with pilot services expected to commence from 
September  2025 . The Front Door will make it simpler to invest in Australia and attract 
more  global and domestic capital . It will act as a single -entry point for investors, help the 
Government to identify priority projects and provide those projects with coordinated 
facilitation services . An Investor Council will support the Front Door to prioritise 
proposals, coordinate public financing and facilitate information sharing on potential 
investment oppor tunities.   
Support for  Australian made  green metals  
The Government is investing in Australia ’s future green metals industries so Australia can 
take advantage of the emerging global green metals opportunity, supporting Australian 
jobs as the economy decarbonises . This investment will also drive innovation in domestic 
heavy manufacturing, with green metals enhancing Australia ’s industrial capabilities and 
supporting progress toward more sustainable production.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 1: Budget Overview  | Page 27 
The Government ’s $2 billion  Green Aluminium Production Credit, available from  2028–29, 
will support Australian aluminium smelters to transition to renewable electricity and 
decarbonise . The Government ’s $1 billion  Green Iron Investment Fund will help establish 
an Australian green iron industry by providing upfront capital support to eligible facilities .  
The Commonwealth Government is also working with the South Australian  Government  
to support the future of steelmaking in Whyalla . The Commonwealth  Government is  
providing immediate support for the Whyalla Steelworks ’ administration process  and for 
creditor assistance payments to support local businesses that would otherwise remain out 
of pocket during the administration period . This is part of a broader $2.4  billion  package, in 
partnership with the South Australian  Government , to support the longer -term 
transformation of the steelworks, which includes consideration of investment through the 
$1 billion  Green Iron Investment Fund and potential  further financing support, subject to 
commercial negotiations.   
Backing Australia ’s small businesses  
The Government is supporting  Australia ’s small businesses in our local communities,  
helping to  drive innovation and productivity.   
Further levelling the playing field for Australia ’s small businesses  
The Government is supporting small businesses to receive timely payment for their work.  
The Government will promote 20-day payment times for contractors and subcontractors 
working for Commonwealth Government Business Enterprises and non -corporate 
Commonwealth entities on major construction activity.   
Illegal phoenix operators cause harm to small businesses and the wider community.  
The Government has committed additional funding for the Australian Securities and 
Investment s Commission  to improve its ability to identify and take enforcement action 
against those involved in illegal phoenixing conduct, focusing on the sectors that are more 
susceptible and impacted by such conduct, particularly construction.   
The Government will provide funding to continue the stabilisation of Australia ’s business 
registers and undertake targeted uplifts, including linking Director Identification Numbers 
to the Company Register . This reform will improve the quality of information available to 
investors and creditors about directors and further support efforts to combat illegal 
phoenixing.   
The Government will work with states and territories on extending protections from  Unfair 
Trading Practices to small businesses and has committed to delivering a better deal for 
thousands of small businesses in the franchising sector by providing additional funding to 
the ACCC to strengthen its enforcement of the Franchising Code of Conduct  (the Code). 
The Government intends to extend protections from Unfair Contract Terms and Unfair 
Trading Practices to businesses regulated by the Code, subject to consulta tion.

Page 28 | Statement 1: Budget Overview  
Supporting the hospitality sector and alcohol producers  
The Government is providing support for hospitality venues, brewers, distillers and wine 
producers through changes to the alcohol tax settings. The Government will pause 
indexation on draught beer excise for two years from August 2025 and expand the existing 
Excise remission scheme for alcohol manufacturers and Wine Equalisation Tax Producer 
Rebate  by increasing the caps for both schemes to $400,000 from 1  July 2026 .  
Energy bill relief  
From 1  July 2025, around one million  eligible small businesses will receive  $75 per quarter 
off their energy bills  in the September and December quarters , with the Government 
committing around  $1.8 billion  to extend  energy bill relief  for six months . Over the last 
three budgets,  energy bill relief has reduced small business energy bills by up to $800.   
Energy efficiency grants  
The Government is providing $56.7  million  in grants through the Energy Efficiency Grants 
for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises program, delivered over two funding rounds. The 
program assists businesses with grants of up to $25,000 to manage their energy use and 
costs and improve their energy eff iciency through a range of upgrades such as replacing 
inefficient appliances and improving space and water heating systems. Round 1 has 
supported 677 businesses with $15.5  million  of grants and Round 2 is supporting  
1,752  businesses with $41.2  million  of grants.  
Digital and cyber  
Since the 2023 –24 Budget, the Government has invested more than $60  million  to help small 
businesses uplift their cyber security and digital capabilities through the Digital Solutions 
program, Cyber Wardens program, Cyber Resilience Service and the Cyber Health Check . 
Together, these programs help small businesses adopt digital tools and grasp the 
opportunities that going online offers, while supporting small businesses to prevent and 
bounce back from cyber incidents .   
Securing Australia ’s place in the world  
Australia ’s economic and national security are increasingly intertwined as we grapple with 
global risks and the evolving security environment. The Government ’s 2024 National 
Defence Strategy set in motion a transformation of the Australian Defence Force ’s 
capability, focus and structure. This is underpinned by the Government ’s investment of 
$330  billion  in the Defence Integrated Investment Program out to 2033 ‒34 which will mean 
that Defence funding will exceed 2.3  per cent of GDP by the early 2030s . This includes a 
$50.3  billion  investment provided in the 2024 –25 Budget.  
The investment in Defence includes $159  billion  in maritime capability over the decade 
which will support over 8,500  jobs by 2030. Additionally, over 20,000 jobs over the next 
30 years will be created to support the nuclear powered submarine program.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 1: Budget Overview  | Page 29 
Australia has already committed more than $1.3  billion  in military assistance to Ukraine. 
This Budget includes further support for more equipment, as well as $36.0  million  over 
five years from 2024 –25 (and $7.8  million  per year ongoing) for the Australian Embassy in 
Kyiv  which is enabling the return of diplomatic and consular staff to Ukraine . 
The Government is ensuring Australia is a partner of choice in the Pacific, which is 
important for regional stability and economic prosperity. The Government has secured 
ANZ's long -term commitment to banking in the Pacific region, through the provision of a 
10-year guarantee to ANZ starting from 1 July 2025. This is part of the Government’s efforts 
to keep communities and economies connected, and finance flowing in our region.  
This Budget also includes an important $44.6  million  initial investment in response to the 
2024 Independent Intelligence Review.  
Thriving cities, suburbs and regions  
Completing the NBN  
The Government  is making a further equity investment of up to $3  billion  for NBN  Co. 
to upgrade Australia ’s remaining national fibre -to-the-node network and ensure that 
Australians have access to faster and more reliable broadband services . This will 
complete  the rollout of the National Broadband Network, with upgrades to a further 
622,000  premises.  This will work alongside the recently announced Universal Outdoor 
Mobile Obligation, which will establish continent -wide SMS and basic voice service by 
2027  through the use of new Low Earth Orbit Satellite technology.  
Delivering transport infrastructure  
The Government is continuing to refocus its over $120  billion  10-year infrastructure 
investment pipeline on nationally significant road and rail projects that will improve the 
productivity  and resilience , liveability and sustainability of our cities, regions and 
communities .  
Since MYEFO, the Government has announced a $7.2  billion  investment in the 
Bruce  Highway – Targeted Safety Package, enhancing a critical transport route through 
Queensland .  
The Government is providing $1 7.1 billion  over ten years from 2024 –25 for new and 
existing road and rail  projects as part of the Infrastructure Investment Program, including 
$2 billion  to upgrade Sunshine Station and $1  billion  for the Road Blitz with the 
Victorian  Government, $1  billion  towards supporting the South West Sydney Rail 
Extension, and $200  million  for the duplication of  the Stuart Highway from Darwin to

Page 30 | Statement 1: Budget Overview  
Supporting regional banking  
The Government has secured commitments from the banks to ensure banking services 
remain available in the regions . All major banks have now committed to a moratorium on 
regional branch closures for two and a half years, which will ensure no regional branch 
closures by these banks before 31  July 2027.  
The Government has also secured agreement of the banking sector to increase its 
investment in Australia Post ’s Bank@Post service . The major banks are expected to have 
new Bank@Post agreements in place with Australia Post soon and Macquarie and HSBC 
are now also in negotiations on Bank@Post . These new agreements will improve the 
financial outlook for Bank@Post and provide greater certainty and choice to banking 
customers, particularly in rural and regional areas.  
Keeping our regions connected  
The Government is providing up to $130  million  in secured loans to keep Rex Airlines 
operational during its extended voluntary administration to 30  June  2025, while a 
competitive sale process is held . The Government is working with the states and the 
airline ’s administrators to maintain connectivity and critical aviation services for regional 
and remote communities.   
Protecting our environment  
The Government is providing  $262.0  million  over five years from 2025 –26 to meet its 
‘30 by 30’ commitment of conserving  30 per cent of Australia ’s landmass and 30  per cent of 
Australia ’s marine areas by 2030.  
The Government will partner with state and territory governments and private landholders 
to preserve  Australia ’s iconic bushland. This will be done through a range of measures 
including investment in nature repair market projects and working with landholders in 
regions with high biodiversity value, creating havens for endangered species, restoring 
degraded governme nt land and supporting the establishment of new Indigenous Protected 
Areas. It  will also build on the Government ’s investment s that have increase d ocean 
protection  while continuing to support sustainable commercial fisheries .  
Broadening opportunity and advancing equality  
The Government is making investments to support the most vulnerable, broaden economic 
opportunities and safeguard the critical services Australians rely on. Key initiatives include 
record investments in women ’s safety, improving service delivery for veterans, supporting 
economic empowerment for First Nations Australians and improving the lives of people 
living with disability.   Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 1: Budget Overview  | Page 31 
Ending  gender -based violence  
In this Budget , the Government is increasing  its investments to end the national crisis of 
gender -based violence by providing additional funding to strengthen justice system 
responses to sexual violence. These funds will support targeted measures to improve 
victim and survivor engagement with the justice system and inform a broader response to 
the Australian Law Reform Commission  Inquiry into Justice Responses to Sexual Violence.  
The Government is also providing additional funding to support the continued deliver y of 
family, domestic and sexual violence services to First Nations women, children and 
communities.  
Initiatives in this Budget bring the Government ’s investments to support women ’s safety 
and deliver the National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children 2022 –32 to over 
$4 billion  since the 2022 –23 October Budget .   
This is in addition to $3.9 billion  over five years from 2025 –26 to establish a new National 
Access to Justice Partnership to  support  access to legal services, including for people 
experiencing gender -based violence . 
Looking after our veterans  
The Government has released its response to the Final Report of the Royal Commission into 
Defence and Veteran Suicide, setting out a plan for real, meaningful and enduring reform 
to improve wellbeing for Defence Force personnel, veterans and families.  
This Government has provided over $1.1  billion  in funding, including a further 
$47.6  million  in this Budget, to the Department of Veterans ’ Affairs (DVA) to ensure it 
continues to be appropriately resourced. Government investments in DVA have eliminated 
the backlog of veterans ’ compensation and rehabilitation claims and resulted in 
$13.0  billion  additional payments flowing to veterans.  
First Nations economic empowerment  
The Government has delivered further investment in economic empowerment for First 
Nations people and communities. This includes  boosting Indigenous Business Australia ’s 
(IBA) Home Loan Capital Fund by $70 .9 million  over two years from 2025 –26, which will 
enable more First Nations Australians to own their home and build intergenerational 
wealth . This complements reforms to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005  that 
came into effect on 1 5 February  2025 and give IBA the ability to borrow and raise funds to 
invest in First Nations business and communities . 
The Government is also supporting  a new place -based business mentoring and coaching 
program to support First Nations businesswomen and entrepreneurs achieve financial and 
economic success . To increase opportunities for  First Nations businesses  to grow and create 
jobs, the Government is  strengthening the Indigenous Procurement Policy .   
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 32 | Statement 1: Budget Overview  
The Government is investing $506.4 million  to support better outcomes for First Nations 
Australians and close the gap. This includes funding to improve access to culturally safe 
and qualified mental health supports, build a nutrition workforce across remote 
communities and improve the detection and management of rheumatic heart disease.  
These measures are in addition to the Northern Territory Remote Aboriginal Investment, 
which was established in partnership with the Northern Territory Government and 
Aboriginal Peak Organisations Northern  Territory . This investment of $842.6  million  will 
assist remote communities access economic development and employment opportunities , 
and improve health, safety and education outcomes . 
Improving the lives of people living with disability  
The Government is  invest ing $423.8  million  to support people with disability . This includes  
$364.5  million  to provide general supports for people with disability and their families, 
carers and kin. These supports will complement additional foundational supports to be 
co-funded with states and territories.  
The Government is also providing $42.2  million  to deliver the National Autism Strategy 
and $17.1  million  to establish the Accessible Australia program to increase inclusive public 
infrastructure.  
This funding builds on over $3  billion  of investment by this Government to improve the 
lives and safety of people with disability in Australia.  
The Government continues to improve the NDIS to deliver better outcomes and ensure 
every dollar allocated to NDIS participants reaches them and is spent in a meaningful way 
that makes a difference in their lives. These reforms will help safeguard the susta inability of 
the NDIS, ensuring it can continue to support future generations of Australians.   
Statement 2: Economic Outlook  | Page 33 Statement 2:  
Economic Outlook  
The Australian economy has turned a corner , despite difficult global conditions.  Inflation 
continues to moderate and has returned to the Reserve Bank of Australia ’s (RBA)  target 
band without a period of negative growth, the unemployment rate remains low and real 
wages are rising. Every Australian taxpayer is receiving a tax cut and interest rates have 
begun to fall. The economy recorded a solid rebound in growth at the end  of last year and 
momentum is expected to gradually improve.  
There is heightened uncertainty in the global economy including from trade tensions and 
conflict in the Middle East and Europe. The escalation of trade tensions has significantly 
magnified  volatility in global markets and could disrupt global and domestic trade, 
investment flows and economic activity , and push up prices . Global  growth is already 
subdued,  and this is expected to continue for the next three years. Around three quarters of 
OECD nations have recorded a negative quarter of growth over the past 1 8 months.  
Inflation has fallen across most advanced economies but , for some , this has come at the cost 
of higher unemployment, very weak growth or recession. While global inflationary 
pressures are abating, disinflation has stalled in some economies. This has led some central 
banks to exercise more caution in relation to further e asing of monetary policy.  
The Australian economy has not been immune to challenging conditions at home . 
Communities and businesses across Australia including in north Queensland, 
Far North Queensland, southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales  have  faced 
natural disasters like ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred  which  have curtailed economic activity, 
harmed industries, and damaged homes  and infrastructure . The impact of ex-Tropical 
Cyclone Alfred  could subtract up to  ¼ of a percentage point from quarterly growth.  
A soft landing in our economy is increasingly likely. Unlike the experience of other  
advanced economies  and previous inflationary episodes, Australia has been able to achieve 
a substantial moderation in inflation while maintaining a low unemployment rate.  Recent 
outcomes for inflation and unemployment have been better than expected, and the 
near -term outlook has improved on both fronts.  This means that the Australian economy is 
one of the best placed to navigate this period of heightened uncertainty.  
Inflation has moderated significantly from its peak in both headline and underlying terms. 
Headline inflation returned to the RBA ’s target band in the second half of 2024  and is now 
expected to be 2½ per cent through the year to the June quarter 2025, a ¼ of a percentage 
point lower than forecast  at MYEFO. Excluding the temporary impact of energy rebates 
and fuel, inflation is expected to sustainably return to the RBA ’s target band around the 
middle of this year, earlier than expected at MYEFO. As a result of the easing inflationary 
pressures, the Reserve Bank Board  reduced its target cash rate to 4.10  per cent in February.  
The labour market has outperformed expectations. The unemployment rate has stayed low, 
the participation rate remains elevated , and employment has grown by more than  
 
Page 34 | Statement 2: Economic Outlook   one million people since May 2022  with around 80  per cent of jobs created in the private 
sector  since the June quarter 2022 . Strong employment growth has helped to limit the 
increase in the unemployment rate from its recent t rough. The unemployment rate is 
forecast to peak at  4¼ per cent, which is ¼ of a percentage point below MYEFO . 
The strength of labour market conditions and moderating  inflation have continued to drive 
growth in real wages. Annual real wages have now grown for five consecutive quarters 
and are forecast to grow by ½ per cent in 2024 –25, which is  ¼ of a percentage point higher  
compared to MYEFO,  and ¼ per cent in 2025 –26. Nominal wages are expected to continue 
growing above the pre -pandemic average.  
Growth  picked up at the end of last year, supported by a recovery in private final demand. 
The economy grew 0.6  per cent in the December quarter, which is more than the average of 
the previous three  quarters. Momentum is expected to continue to build, with growth 
forecast to continue to pick up from 1½ per cent in 2024 –25 to 2¼ per cent in 2025 –26 and 
2½ per cent in 2026 –27.  
The improvement in growth is expected to be broad -based and supported by stronger  
private final demand. After stalling in the middle of last year, consumption grew 
0.4 per cent in the December quarter 2024. The Government ’s tax cuts, the easing in 
inflation and strong employment and wage growth have resulted in real household 
disposable income per capita returning  to grow th in the second half of 2024 , supporting the  
gradual recovery in consumption  growth.  
Investment is expected to support activity over the forecast period. Business investment has 
grown solidly for the past two years. While growth is forecast to moderate over the period 
ahead, the level of business investment is expected to remain at its recent decade highs. 
Dwelling investment is expected to grow from this financial year.  
Public final demand helped ensure the economy continued to grow . This has been driven 
by spending on demand -driven programs in health, education and social services, as well 
as energy bill relief and infrastructure spending by state and federal governments. Growth 
in public final demand is expected to moderate over the forecast period.  
The Australia n economy faces a range of domestic risks, including the uncertainty 
confronting communities recover ing from the effect  of natural disasters . Growth could also 
be weaker in the near  term if households continue to prioritise savings  over consumption 
as real incomes recover . A continued and sustained depreciation of the exchange rate, or a 
stalling in the moderation of services inflation could also pose upside risk to inflation.   
Global developments also cast a shadow over the Australian economic outlook. Ongoing 
weaker economic conditions in China could lead to lower service and commodity exports. 
Policy uncertainty related to trade tensions could weigh on domestic investment and 
employment. The use of tariffs by major trading partners could lead to higher import prices 
and temporarily higher inflation and lower growth. Nonetheless, the progress the 
Australian economy has made over the past couple of years means that it is well  placed to 
manage these challenges .

Statement 2: Economic Outlook  | Page 37 Statement 2: Economic Outlook  
Outlook for the international economy  
The escalation of global trade tensions has contributed to significant market volatility and 
made the international outlook more uncertain. Tariffs and other trade barriers could 
weigh on global growth by disrupting trade and investment flows, driving up c osts for 
businesses and consumers  (Box 2.1) . The related policy uncertainty may exacerbate the 
risks to business investment, employment and household spending. A slowdown in global 
growth stemming from these pressures would also adversely affect demand for  key 
Australian exports, domestic business confidence , and investment.  These risks compound 
the uncertainty in the global economy from conflict in the Middle East and Europe and 
challenges in the Chinese economy.  
Against this backdrop of greater  uncertainty, t he global economy is expected to grow by 
3¼ per cent in each of the next three years. If realised, this would represent the longest 
stretch of below -average growth since the early  1990s.  The global outlook remains clouded 
by uneven risks in the trajectory of growth, inflation and monetary policy.   
Globally, inflation has moderated, but disinflation appears to have stalled in many major 
economies. This has prompted some central banks to adopt a more cautious stance toward 
further monetary policy easing, which poses a downside risk to the global outlo ok. 
Inflation is expected to continue moderating across major ad vanced economies  in 2025, 
albeit more gradually. Outside of Australia, very few advanced economies  have managed 
to reduce inflation  while sustaining  a relatively robust  labour market and unbro ken 
economic growth .

Page 38 | Statement 2: Economic Outlook   
Box 2.1 : Risks of an escalation in global trade tensions  
Tariffs and trade restrictions have become more common in recent years. According 
to the IMF, restrictions on trade and investment have grown sixfold in the past 
15 years. Tariffs generally raise prices for businesses and consumers by increasing 
the cost of imported goods, which lowers growth.  
Tariff reductions since the 1970s have provided significant benefits to the Australian 
economy. Sectors exposed to trade are typically the most productive, as firms 
exposed to global competition are forced to innovate and improve efficiency. Even 
small tar iffs create inefficiencies and costs for businesses and consumers. The 
Government ’s 2024–25 Budget included the elimination of around 500 nuisance 
tariffs, which will lower costs and improve productivity.  
Tariffs directly imposed on Australian exports lower demand by making them more 
expensive to purchase in the country imposing the tariffs. This effect could be offset 
to some extent by a depreciation of the Australian dollar, which would make 
Australian ex ports less expensive in foreign currency terms. Australian firms have 
also demonstrated that they are very adept at finding alternative markets for 
Australian exports.  
The Australian economy will also be affected indirectly when tariffs are placed on 
the exports of countries that use Australian exports as inputs. This indirect trade 
effect can be larger than the direct effect given that Australia exports large volumes 
of raw materials that are often used to produce goods that are then exported.  
A scenario in which the United States imposes a 25  per cent tariff on all imports of 
durable manufacturing goods, such as steel and aluminium, illustrates these points. 
The imposition of the  tariff leads to a reduction in the real GDP of Australia, China 
and the United States  over time.  Overall, the total impact (direct plus indirect) of the 
tariffs on Australia ’s economy by 2030 is expected to be modest  (Chart 2.1).  
The indirect effect  of the tariffs is estimated  to be nearly four times as large as the 
direct effect , reflecting  the relative importance of affected trade flows  between 
Australia, China, and the United States.  In this scenario,  the United States also 
experiences a persistent increase in inflationary pressures because  imports become  
more expensive , while Australia experiences a small temporary increase in inflation 
related to a depreciation of the Australian dollar (Chart 2 .2). 
If all countries, including Australia and China, retaliate by imposing a 25  per cent  
tariff on all imports of durable manufacturing goods from the U nited States, the loss 
in real GDP is amplified for all countries, as is the increase in inflationary pressures 
(Chart s 2.3 and 2.4).

Escalating trade tensions have  created significant uncertainty and volatility in global 
financial markets. These factors can compound the direct and indirect effects of 
tariffs on global growth captured in the scenarios above by discouraging investment 
and dampening consumer confidence .

Page 40 | Statement 2: Economic Outlook   
Outlook for major trading  partners  
China’s economy faces growing near -term pressures from the property sector downturn 
and rising trade tensions with the United States . However, the lagged effects of policy 
easing in late -2024 plus the announcement of increased  fiscal support are expected to 
support growth  in 2025 . In the longer -term , structural challenges , including a shrinking 
workforce and lower  productivity  growth, will weigh on domestic demand and growth . 
In 2024, China’s economy grew by 5  per cent, in line with its official growth target  
(Chart  2.5). Industrial  production and exports picked up  late in the year , in part due to 
orders brought forward  in anticipation  of the imposition of higher import tariffs in  the 
United States . This growth  in exports has helped offset weak  consumption and property 
investment  activity .  
While Chinese authorities  continue to support  strategic sectors like electric vehicles and 
green technology, it will be difficult for China  to replace traditional growth drivers like 
real estate and infrastructure  investment . Given the scale of China ’s exports to the 
United  States , escalating trade tensions would  directly affect exports and have implications 
for investment in trade -exposed sectors .

The United States  economy outperform ed other advanced economies in 2024  (Chart 2. 6). 
Robust productivity growth has enabled inflation to fall significantly from its mid -2022 
peaks, even with strong consumer demand  fuelled by a resilient labour market and strong 
income growth. However, persistent price pressures in the services sector , alongside early  
signs of a possible  resurgence in goods inflation, have  stalled progress towards the Federal 
Reserve’s target . The Federal Reserve has indicated  that it is wel l positioned  but is waiting  
to see  the impact  of the US administration ’s policy  agenda .  
Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 2: Economic Outlook  | Page 41 
Recent trade policies and the associated policy uncertainty  are having a negative impact on  
consumer and business sentiment, increasing inflation expectations , and  affecting  trade  
between the United States and the rest of the world . The US administration  has also 
foreshadowed changes to fiscal settings  and a focus on deregulation  which, depending on 
how they are  approach ed, have the potential to stimulate spending and investment.  
Euro area  GDP is forecast to strengthen to 1  per cent in 2025 , and 1¼ per cent in both 2026  
and 2027 . Inflation is expected to decline to the European Central Bank ’s target by the end 
of 2025 . Less restrictive monetary policy  and rising real wages are expected to support 
consumption  in the near term . The prospect of increased  defen ce and infrastructure 
spending (particularly in Germany ) could also boost  growth.  However, German  industrial 
weakness  and the continuing transition away from Russian energy source s pose downside 
risk to the outlook.  
The scale of the European Union ’s trade relationships with both China  and the 
United  States  offers  it substantial  influence  over the evolution of global trade tensions . 
In 2024,  concerns about  state support for China’s electric vehic le supply chain led the 
European Commission to impose tariffs  on Chinese electric vehicle imports . More recently , 
the European Commission responded to  US tariffs on European steel  and aluminium 
exports with a n array  of countermeasures . 
Economic growth in t he United Kingdom  picked up gradually in 2024, driven by increased 
household and government spending. However, this was offset by soft business investment 
and a decline in exports. Growth is expected to be subdued in 2025 as a temporary 
expansion in government expenditure wanes  in the second half of the year. The UK 
economy is expected to recover moderately in 2026 and 2027 driven by a pick -up in 
household consumption and business investment.  
In Japan , economic momentum slowed in mid -2024 amid temporary supply disruptions in 
the auto sector, before regaining momentum in the second half of the year as supply 
disruptions abated. Recent strong wage growth is expected to persist into 2025, and it is 
expected to contribute to inflation  remain ing above the Bank of Japan ’s 2 per cent target 
through to 2026. Growth is expected to be around 1 ¼ per cent in 2025 before easing over 
the course of 2026 and 2027.  
India  is forecast to grow by 6¾  per cent in 2025 and 6½  per cent in 2026 and 2027. Private 
consumption and investment remain crucial drivers of India ’s economic growth, with 
various signs indicating the slowdown in 2024 was transitory. Near -term growth is 
expected to be driven by ongoing robustness in domestic consumption, increased 
government spending, easing of monetary policy, and an expansion of the manufacturing 
sector under key government initiatives.  
Other East Asia  is forecast to grow by 4  per cent in 2025, 2026 and 2027. Domestic demand 
of key economies in the region is expected to be bolstered by an easing of  monetary policy. 
However, escalating trade tensions could dampen investor confidence and weigh on 
growth .   
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 42 | Statement 2: Economic Outlook   
Outlook for the domestic economy  
Despite heightened global uncertainty , growth has picked up and a soft landing is looking 
increasingly likely  (Box 2.2). The economy is expected to gain further  momentum over 2025  
as private final demand  gradually recovers . Real GDP is forecast to grow by 1 ½ per cent in 
2024–25, 2¼  per cent in 2025 –26 and 2½  per cent in 2026 –27.  
Ex-Tropical  Cyclone Alfred and the subsequent flooding significantly  affected communities 
and businesses in  southeast  Quee nsland and northern New South  Wales . The disaster 
curtailed economic activity, harmed industries, and damaged homes and infrastructure.  
The direct loss of economic activity could  temporarily lower quarterly growth  by up to  
¼ of a percent age point. This reflects  impacts  on activity  in the agricultural, construction, 
retail , transport  and tourism industries . Subsequent  reconstruction effor ts are expected to 
add to real GDP growth in following  quarters , although the magnitude and timing of the  
effect on activity is uncertain . It could also add upward pressure to prices through damage 
to crops and the rebuilding work.  
Household c onsumption growth remained subdued over 2024  with many  households  
continu ing to face cost -of-living pressures , including high mortgage costs . However, 
growth in r eal household disposable income  is forecast  to continue to pick  up, which  is 
expected to  drive  a gradual rise in consumption  over the forecast period.  
Public final demand helped ensure the economy continued to grow  over the past two years. 
Growth in 2024–25 is higher than expected at MYEFO due to mid-year updates to state 
government budgets  and demand -driven programs . However, public demand is expected 
to moderate  as private final demand becomes a more prominent driver of growth in the 
economy . 
Business investment has grown solidly for two years and, although growth is forecast to 
moderate, is expected to remain at recent decade highs. Non -mining investment is expected 
to be the main contributor to growth over coming years, supported by investment in 
renewable energy infrastructure, warehouses and data centres. Dwelling  investment is 
expected to accelerate  from 2025 –26 in response to robust housing demand  and an easing to 
both supply -side constraints and financing costs.  
Employment growth has been strong and the unemployment rate has remained low. The 
strength of the labour market has contributed to  a smaller -than -expected rise in the 
unemployment rate . The unemployment rate  is forecast to peak at 4¼ per cent, which is  
¼ of a percentage point lower compared to MYEFO , and nominal wage growth is expected 
to remain above pre -pandemic rates .  
Inflation has moderated substantially, and recent progress has been better  than  expected. 
Inflation is now forecast to be 2½ per cent through the year to the June quarter 2025, a 
¼ of a percentage point lower than expected at MYEFO. Excluding energy rebates and fuel, 
inflation is expected to return sustainably to the target band around the middle of this year. 
The better near -term outlook for inflation means that real wages are now expected to grow 
½ per cent in 2024 –25, an upgrade of ¼ of a percentage poin t since MYEFO .

Note:  These  forecasts are based on several technical assumptions. The exchange rate is assumed to 
remain around its recen t average level – a trade‑weighted index of around 60 and a $US exchange 
rate of around 62 US cents. The cash rate assumption  is informed by the Bloomberg survey of 
market economists and is assumed to be around 50 basis points lower by the end of 2025.  World 
oil prices (Malaysian Tapis) are assumed to remain flat around US $81 per barrel.  The labour 
market forecasts do not incorporate the February 2025 release of the ABS Labour Force.

Household consumption  
Households continue to face cost -of-living pressures, but  these pressures are easing. Lower 
inflation, continued employment growth, higher wage s, tax cuts, and the recent reduction 
in interest rates will support a pick -up in real household disposable income  (Chart  2.7). 
Real household disposable income in 2026 –27 is forecast to be around 8¾ per cent higher 
compared to 2023 –24. This is expected to support a gradual pick -up in household 
consumption, with consumption forecast to grow by ¾ per cent in 2024 –25 and 2¼ per cent 
in both 2025 –26 and 2026 –27 (Chart 2. 8).

Dwelling  investment  
There are signs that capacity constraints  in the construction sector are gradually easing. 
Inflation in the price of construction materials has fallen and the availability of suitable 
labour is beginning to improve. Alongside the easing in capacity constraints, financing 
costs are also expected to moderate. This will enable construction activity to gradually 
respond to robust housing demand, with dwelling  investment expected to grow by 
1½ per cent in 2024 –25, 5½ per cent in 2025 –26 and 7½ per cent in 2026 –27 (Chart 2. 9). 
Business investment  
Business investment has grown solidly for two years, supported by resilient business 
balance sheets and elevated levels of capacity utilisation. While growth in business 
investment is expected to moderate, the level of business investment is expected to re main 
elevated at decade highs.   
Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 2: Economic Outlook  | Page 45 
Non -mining investment is expected to be the main contributor to growth in business 
investment over coming years, with key investments focused on renewable energy 
infrastructure, warehouses and data centres.  
In the near term, mining investment growth is expected to moderate as new LNG projects 
reach completion. Future mining investment is largely expected to maintain  current 
production levels, alongside a modest number of new small LNG and metal ore projects.  
Public final demand  
Growth in p ublic demand has helped to ensure the economy has continued to grow but is 
forecast to moderate over the period ahead as growth in the private sector recovers . 
Growth in public demand has been driven by spending on essential services, cost -of-living 
relief and infrastructure at all levels of government . Growth in the most recent quarter  was 
driven entirely by state spending, with the Commonwealth component falling.  
Public demand growth is forecast to moderate from 5 per cent in 2024 –25 to 2 per cent in 
2026–27 (Chart 2. 10). Growth in 2024 –25 has been revised up since  MYEFO reflecting  
mid-year updates to  state budgets  and demand -driven programs in health, education and 
social services . The expected moderation in growth is underpinned by  structural reforms to 
Commonwealth programs  taking effect , including the National Disability Insurance 
Scheme and Aged Care , and the work ing through of the strong  pipeline of infrastruc ture 
projects.

International trade  
Growth in exports is expected to moderate to 1 per cent in 2024 –25, with services exports 
growth slowing following the sharp rebound in education and tourism exports in recent 
years. Non -rural commodity exports are expected to remain subdued,  reflecting  ongoing 
weak conditions in the Chinese property sector. Exports are forecast to grow by 2½ per cent 
in both 2025–26 and 2026 –27.  
Growth in import volumes is expected to moderate to 2½ per cent in 2024 –25. This reflects 
the slowing in service imports, although goods imports are expected to be supported by 
strength in infrastructure projects. Growth is expecte d to be 4 per cent in 2025 –26 and 
2½ per cent in 2026 –27. 
Labour market  and wages  
The labour market remains a source of strength with the unemployment rate remaining 
low at around 4  per cent over the past three quarters, participation remain ing elevated  and 
over one million additional people employed since May 2022  (Chart 2. 11). 
The labour market is forecast to remain robust  over the period ahead. Since MYEFO, the 
outlook for employment growth has been upgraded and the participation rate is now 
expected to remain higher for longer. The peak in the unemployment rate is expected to be 
4¼ per cent, a ¼ of a percentage point lower  than forecast at MYEFO .  
Nominal wage growth has eased over 2024 –25 but , given the stronger labour market and 
expected improvement in productivity growth , is expected to  remain above pre -pandemic 
rates  (Chart 2. 12). The Wage Price Index (WPI) grew by 3.2  per cent through the year to the 
December  quarter  2024 and is expected to grow by 3  per cent through the year to the June 
quarter of 2025 and 3¼  per cent to June 2026.  
The strength of labour market conditions  and easing in inflation means that real wages 
are growing again. Real wages, as measured by annual growth in WPI relative to the 
annual growth in CPI, grew 0.8  per cent through the year to December  2024. Real wages 
are forecast to grow ½ per cent through the year to June quarter 2025 , which is  
¼ of a percentage point higher compared to  MYEFO,  and ¼ per cent through the year to 
June quarter 2026.

Inflation  
Inflation has moderated substantially across both hea dline and underlying measures. 
Headline  inflation was 2.4 per cent through  the year to December 2024, which is less  than a 
third of its 2022  peak. Underlying inflation is now less than half its peak at 3.2  per cent 
through the year to December quarter 2024 and is 2.7  per cent on a six -month annualised 
basis.  
Recent progress on inflation has been better than anticipated, with inflation now expected 
to be 2½ per cent through the year to the June quarter 2025, which is a ¼ of a percentage 
point lower than expected at the time of MYEFO. Headline  inflation  is forecast to be  just 
below 3 per cent through the year to the June quarter 2026 and then be around the middle 
of the target band for the remainder of the forecast  period  (Chart 2. 13). Abstracting from 
the impact of fuel and energy rebates, inflation is expected to sustainably be in the target 
band around the middle of 2025 . This  is earlier than was forecast at MYEFO , when inflation 
was not expected to be sustainably back in the band until late 2025.  The Reserve Bank 
Board  reduced the cash rate in February following the moderation in inflation.  
Inflationary pressures have eased across a broad range of goods and services. Growth in 
goods prices normalised rapidly in 2023 and 2024, and services prices have shown signs of 
moderating  (Chart 2.1 4). In particular, inflation in insurance prices is expected to have 
passed its peak , although premium  prices have increased substantially to reflect major 
event risks , repair and replacement costs . Growth in rental prices has moderated as 
demand has softened and vacancy rates have increased. In addition, inflat ion in new 
dwelling prices has fallen significantly to be close to a tenth of its peak as capacity 
constraints in the construction sector ease.   
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 48 | Statement 2: Economic Outlook   
The moderation in inflation has been assisted by cost -of-living relief and the decline in  
petrol prices  around the end of 2024.  Electricity rebates from Commonwealth and state 
governments and the additional indexation of Commonwealth Rent Assistance reduced 
headline inflation by ¾ of a percentage point through the year to the December quarter of 
2024.  Without Commonwealth  and state government  electricity rebates, electricity bills 
would have been , on average, around 45  per cent higher in the December quarte r 2024. 
The extension of electricity rebates in this Budget will directly reduce annual inflation by 
½ of a percentage point through the year to the December quarter 2025.

Box 2.2: Australia ’s progress towards a soft landing  
The Australian economy remains on track for a soft landing following the sharpest 
rise in global inflation in recent decades. Macroeconomic policies have been 
calibrated to bring inflation down while preserving labour market gains, and 
managing risks to gr owth.  
Headline inflation is now less than a third of its peak in 2022 and is near the middle 
of the RBA ’s target band. Progress on inflation led the RBA to lower interest rates by 
25 basis points in February 2025 – the first reduction in over four years. At the same 
time, the Australian economy has sustained a low unemployment rate of around 
4 per cent or le ss since the start of 2022, and the economy has continued to grow. The 
December quarter 2024 National Accounts showed that the economy had turned a 
corner, wi th growth picking up in the quarter. Importantly, the private sector made 
a greater contribution to quarterly growth.  
Australia ’s experience compares favourably to historical and international 
experiences. The economy has added more than one million jobs since the RBA 
started raising interest rates in May 2022, with growth in jobs higher than during 
previous tightening episodes, particularly over the past 16 months (Chart 2.15). The 
participation rate and employment -to-population ratio in Australia have recently 
achieved record highs. The unemployment rate has risen by 0.7 percentage points 
since its low in 2022. By way of  comparison, in the early 1990s, the unemployment 
rate rose by around 5  percentage points.  
Despite heightened risks in the global economy, Australia is set to maintain this 
momentum. Prospects for jobseekers remain positive. The number of vacancies per 
unemployed person remains elevated, and youth unemployment remains around 
3 percentage points lower than pre -pandemic rates. Growth in private demand and 
market -sector employment are expected to continue to gradually pick up as 
increases in real household disposable incomes support a recovery in consumption 
growth.  
Unlike every major advanced economy, Australia has sustained positive quarterly 
economic growth during the most recent phase of monetary policy tightening. 
Strong policy responses have brought down inflation in peer economies, but in most 
cases, this has o ccurred alongside weaker outcomes for economic growth and the 
labour market (Chart 2 .16). The United Kingdom and New Zealand have 
experienced multiple quarters of negative growth. In New Zealand the 
unemployment rate is 5.1  per cent and in Canada it is 6. 6 per cent. In both of those 
economies it has increased by nearly 2 percentage points from their 2022 lows, more 
than two and a half times the increase in Australia.

Net overseas migration  
Net overseas migration (NOM) is declining from its peak in 2022 –23 reflecting lower  
migrant arrivals. NOM is forecast to ease further over the forward estimates. Arrivals are 
expected to continue to decline in 2024 –25 before stabilising in 2025 –26. Departures are 
expected to pick up from recent sustained lows as more people who arrived after the 
pandemic near the expiry of their visa . 
Nominal GDP and the medium -term outlook  
Nominal GDP is expected to grow by 4¼  per cent in 202 4–25. Nominal GDP growth is then 
expected to slow to 3¼  per cent in 2025–26 as a pick -up in  economic  growth is offset by a 
moderation in domestic inflation and sharper fall in the terms of trade.   
The fiscal aggregates are underpinned by economic forecasts over the Budget estimates 
period and project ions over the medium term ( Chart 2. 17).

Beyond the detailed forecast horizon of  2026–27, Treasury uses a macroeconometric model 
of the Australian economy for its forecasts and projections. The model informs how the 
economy returns to its trend level of output, known as potential GDP.  
The long -run level of potential real GDP is ¼ per cent lower than MYEFO . This reflects 
continuing weak underlying productivity growth, which pre -dated COVID -19 
pandemic -related disruptions , that are largely expected to unwind.   
In the long run, underlying productivity is assumed to grow at 1.2  per cent per year , the 
unemployment rate remains  at Treasury ’s Non -Accelerating Inflation Rate of 
Unemployment (NAIRU) assumption of 4 ¼ per cent and d omestic inflation c onverges  to 
the midpoint of the RBA ’s target band .

Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  | Page 53 Statement 3:  
Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  
This Budget continues the Government ’s record of responsible economic and fiscal 
management.  The underlying cash balance has improved by a cumulative $ 207 billion  over 
the s even  years to 202 8–29, compared to the 2022  Pre-election Economic  and Fiscal Outlook 
(PEFO). This is  the largest nominal budget improvement in a parliamentary term.  After 
delivering the first back -to-back surpluses in nearly two decades , the underlying cash 
deficit in 2024–25 is almost half what was forecast at the PEFO .  
Gross debt is $ 177 billion  lower in 2024 –25 than forecast at the PEFO.  This will help avoid 
more than $60 billion  in interest costs over the eleven years to  2032–33. Gross debt is 
expected to peak at 37.0 per cent of GDP  in 2029–30, 7.9 percentage points lower than the 
peak in the PEFO, before declining to 31.9 per cent of GDP by 2035 –36.  
The Government ’s record of finding savings , limiting spending growth , and banking the 
majority of tax receipt upgrades has helped to deliver a stronger fiscal outlook. The 
Government has delivered $ 94.1 billion  in savings and reprioritisations since the PEFO.  
Over the seven  years to 2028 –29, real payments growth is estimated to average 1.7 per cent 
per year, around  half the average of 3.2  per cent over the past 30  years. The Government 
has also returned  69 per cent of tax receipt upgrades to the budget since the PEFO.  
Fiscal policy has worked with monetary policy to return inflation to the Reserve Bank of 
Australia ’s (RBA’s) target band in the second half of 2024 . The Government ’s fiscal settings 
are consistent with inflation sustainably returning to the target band  around the middle of 
2025.  
The Budget position is stronger in every year of the forward estimates than the PEFO and 
cumulatively stronger over the forward estimates than MYEFO. A deficit of $42.1 billion  is 
forecast in 2025–26, an improvement  of $4.8 billion  since MYEFO.   
The Government has also made significant progress in addressing longer term structural 
spending pressures including interest costs on debt, the National Disability Insurance 
Scheme (NDIS) and aged care.  
These improvements have been achieved at the same time as the Government has taken 
pressure off Australians by delivering responsible cost -of-living relief and invested in 
strengthening Medicare and building a more competitive and dynamic economy.  
The Government ’s responsible approach is recognised by ratings agencies. Australia 
remains one of only nine countries with a AAA sovereign credit rating from all three major 
ratings agencies. This year, Australia ’s gross debt -to-GDP (including all levels of 
government) is expected to be around half the advanced  economy average, more than 
50 percentage points below the United Kingdom, and more than 70  percentage points 
below the United States.

Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  | Page 57 Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  
A deficit of 1.0 per cent of GDP ($27.6 billion ) is forecast for 2024 –25 (Table  3.1). This is  in 
line with MYEFO  and almost half what was forecast at  the PEFO . A deficit of 1.5 per cent of 
GDP ($42.1 billion ) is forecast in 2025 –26, an improvement of 0.2 percentage points since 
MYEFO .  
Since MYEFO, 2024–25 forecast  payments and receipts have decrease d by 0.2 percentage 
points of GDP . In 2025–26, payments are expected to be 0.2 percentage  points lower 
compared to the MYEFO , with receipts forecast to remain broadly unchanged .  
Since the PEFO, the Government has had to commit $ 51.1 billion  in legacy and unavoidable 
spending to resolve issues inherited from the former Government, extend terminating 
measures to ensure Australians do not see cuts to the essential services they rely on, and 
respond to urgent and unforeseen issues .

Page 58 | Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  
Economic and Fiscal Strategy  
The Government ’s Economic and Fiscal Strategy is making the economy and the budget 
stronger, more resilient and more sustainable over the medium term (Box  3.1). The  Strategy 
is consistent with the requirements of the Charter of Budget Honesty Act  1998 , with progress 
reviewed each budget update . The Strategy is unchanged since MYEFO.  
Box 3.1: The Government ’s Economic and Fiscal Strategy   
The Government ’s Economic and Fiscal Strategy will make the economy more 
resilient and put the budget on a more sustainable footing over time.  
The Strategy is focused on the objectives of strong, inclusive and sustainable 
economic growth, full employment, growing real wages, ensuring women ’s 
economic participation and equality, and improving living standards for all 
Australians.  
The Government will improve the budget position in a measured way, consistent 
with the overarching goal of reducing gross debt as a share of the economy over 
time. This approach enables fiscal policy to respond to changes in economic 
conditions to support macroeconomic stability, including in times of high inflation.  
These objectives will be achieved by investments that grow the economy and expand 
productive capacity, and budget discipline that restrains spending growth and 
enhances the quality of spending. The budget will be improved in a manner 
consistent with the ob jective of maintaining full employment, while continuing to 
deliver essential services.  
Putting the budget on a more sustainable footing will ensure the Government has the 
fiscal buffers to withstand economic shocks and better manage the fiscal pressures 
from an ageing population and climate change.  
These commitments will be underpinned by the following elements:  
• Allowing tax receipts and income support to respond in line with changes in the 
economy and directing the majority of improvements in tax receipts to budget 
repair.  
• Limiting growth in spending until gross debt as a share of GDP is on a 
downwards trajectory, while growth prospects are sound and unemployment 
is low.  
• Improving the efficiency, quality and sustainability of spending.  
• Focusing new spending on investments and reforms that build the capability of 
our people, expand the productive capacity of our economy, and support action 
on climate change.  
• Delivering a tax system that funds government services in an efficient, fair and 
sustainable way.   Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  | Page 59 
Delivering on the Economic and Fiscal Strategy  
This Budget delivers on the Government ’s Economic and Fiscal Strategy by:  
• Improving the budget position.  
– The underlying cash balance has improved by a cumulative $207 billion  over the 
seven  years to 2028 –29, compared to projections at the PEFO.   
– Since MYEFO, th e underlying cash balance has improved by $ 1.6 billion  over the 
five years to 2028 –29.  
– A deficit of 1.5 per cent of GDP ($ 42.1 billion ) is forecast in 2025 –26, an improvement 
of 0.2 percentage points of GDP since MYEFO . 
• Reducing debt as a share of the economy over time.    
– Gross debt -to-GDP is expected to peak  at 37.0 per cent at 30 June  2030  and then fall 
to 31.9 per cent at 30  June  2036.  
– Gross debt is lower  by $1 77 billion  in 2024–25, and also lower in every year of the 
projection period than expected at the PEFO .  
– Gross debt -to-GDP  is expected to peak  7.9 percentage points lower than the forecast 
peak at the PEFO. By 30  June  2033, gross debt is projected to be around $76 billion  
(4.9 percentage points of GDP) lower than at the PEFO.  
– Improvements to the budget position, compared to the PEFO, are expected to save 
more than $60 billion  in interest payments over the 11  years to 2032 –33.  
• Repairing the budget through $2.1  billion  in savings and reprioritisations  and 
$1.8 billion  in improvements to the tax system in this Budget.  This brings total savings 
and spending reprioritisations to $94.1  billion , and total budget improvements to 
$123.8  billion , since the PEFO.  
• Limiting spending, with real payments growth over the seven  years to 2028 –29 
averaging 1.7  per cent per year, and 2.7  per cent per year over the five years to 2028 –29. 
This compares to an annual average of 3.2  per cent over the past 30  years.   
• Returning the majority of tax receipt upgrades to the budget.  
– Since coming to Government, t he Government has returned to the budget 
69 per cent of tax receipt upgrades over  the seven  years to 2028–29. 
– The upgrades returned since the PEFO have improved the underlying cash balance 
by a cumulative $ 249.6 billion  over seven  years to 2028 –29, avoiding $ 111.6 billion  in 
interest payments over the 11  years to 2032 –33.   | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 60 | Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  
Fiscal policy has worked with monetary policy to return headline inflation to the target 
band in the second half of 2024. The Government ’s fiscal settings continue to be consistent 
with sustainably returning inflation to the target band, which is expected to occur around 
the middle of this year.  Australia maintains one of the strongest fiscal positions amongst 
peer economies (see B ox 3.2) .  
The Government ’s responsible economic and fiscal management has eased cost -of-living 
pressures for millions of Australians,  delivered the largest nominal budget improvement in 
a parliamentary term  and created the conditions for a stronger, more productive economy.  
Inflation has fallen substantially, unemployment remains low, since mid-2022  employment 
has grown by over one million people, with 80 per cent in private sector jobs , real wages 
are growing,  the gender pay gap is near its narrowest on record,  and interest rates have 
begun  to fall.   
Addressing unavoidable issues  
The Government has had to provide $3.5  billion  over  five years to 2028 –29 for unavoidable 
policy decisions since MYEFO. Investment in these critical areas supports the delivery of 
essential services and prevents cuts to services Australians rely on. Unavoidable policy 
decisions since MYEFO include:  
• new and amended listings on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme  and new and 
amended items on the Medicare Benefits Schedule.  
• addressing unavoidable cost pressures for projects in the Infrastructure Investment 
Program, including the Bruce Highway  – Rockhampton Ring Road in Queensland, 
Barwon Heads Road Upgrade  – Stage 2 in Victoria and Homebush Bay Drive in 
New South Wales.  
• program funding to support the Illicit Tobacco Compliance and Enforcement Package, 
focused on sustained disruption of the illicit trade in tobacco and associated nicotine 
products.  
• supporting implementation of the Aged Care Act 2024  and funding the outcome of the 
Fair W ork Commission ’s decision to increase the minimum award wages of registered 
and enrolled nurses employed in the aged care sector .  
• funding essential government services,  including modernising My Health Record,  
addressing border and biosecurity threats from illegal fishing activities in Australia ’s 
northern waters , and sustaining  the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission , 
Australian Maritime Safety Authority, Australian Transport Safety Bureau and Civil 
Aviation Safety Authority .  
Since the PEFO, the Government has committed $51.1  billion  in unavoidable spending to 
respond to urgent and unforeseen issues, extend terminating measures to continue 
essential services and resolve issues inherited from the former Government.   Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  | Page 61 
Box 3. 2: International comparisons of fiscal performance  
Australia has one of the strongest fiscal positions amongst peer  economies.  Australia 
is one of only nine  countries to maintain a AAA credit rating from all three major 
ratings agencies.  
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects  Australia ’s general government 
budget  deficit (including all levels of government)  to be  two per cent of GDP in 2025. 
This represents an improvement in the budget balance of four  percentage points 
since 2021, a larger improvement than in most comparable economies (Chart  3.1). 
The deficit in Australia in 2025 is expected  to be  less than half of the advanced 
economy average .  
A stronger  budget  position has helped to keep Australia ’s gross debt levels low 
by international standards (Chart  3.2). The IMF projects Australia ’s gross 
debt -to-GDP to be nearly  40 percentage points below lev els in the euro area, 
more  than  50 percentage  points below the United Kingdom, and more than 
70 percentage  points below the United States. Australia is estimated to have the 
fifth lowest gross debt -to-GDP ratio in the G20 in 2025.

Low levels of government debt  ensure that Australia is well placed to navigate a 
more challenging global environment (see Statement 2: Economic Outlook ). It 
maintains Australia ’s capacity to respond to future economic swings should risks 
materialise. At the same time, it preserves the ability to sustain essential services and 
maintains lower borrowing costs than otherwise.    | Budget Paper No. 1

Fiscal outlook  
Underlying cash balance estimates  
The underlying cash balance has improved by a cumulative $1.6  billion  over the five years 
to 2028–29 since MYEFO  and by a cumulative $207  billion  over  the seven years to 2028 –29 
since the PEFO.   
The underlying cash balance is estimated to be a $ 27.6 billion  deficit  (1.0 per cent of GDP) 
in 202 4–25, which is $0.7 billion  higher than forecast at  MYEFO in nominal terms , but 
broadly equiv alent in per cent of GDP terms (Table  3.2). This follows a  $15.8 billion  surplus 
in 2023–  24 and a $22.1 billion  surplus  in 2022–23, the first back -to-back surplus es in nearly 
two decades  and the largest nominal back -to-back surpluses on record . 
An underlying cash deficit of $ 42.1 billion  (1.5 per cent of GDP) is forecast for 202 5–26, a 
$4.8 billion  improvement from the  forecast at  MYEFO. The underlying cash deficit is then  
expected to improve to $36.9 billion  (1.1 per cent of GDP) in 20 28–29.  
Policy decisions since MYEFO have been limited to just $0.1  billion  in 2024–25. O ver the 
five years to 2028–29 net policy decisions have increased the underlying cash deficit by 
$34.9  billion . This includes delivering new tax cuts to every Australian taxpayer from 
1 July 2026 and further responsible cost -of-living relief, $3.5 billion in unavoidable 
spending  and $2.2  billion  in additional funding for hospitals and public schools . Parameter 
and other variations since  MYEFO have decreased  the underlying cash deficit  by 
$36.4  billion over the five year s to 2028 –29.  
In this Budget, $8.3  billion of policy decisions were funded by provisions from previous 
updates , limiting their impacts on the underlying cash balance in this update.   Budget Paper No. 1  |

Receipts estimates  
Since MYEFO, forecast  total receipts have increased  by $6.9 billion  in 2025–26 and 
decrease d by $5.8 billion over the five years to  2028–29.  
Since MYEFO, forecast  tax receipts have increased  by $6.4 billion in 2025–26 and decrease d 
by $6.6 billion over the five  years to 2028 –29. Since MYEFO, forecast non-tax receipts have 
increased  by $0.5 billion in 2025–26 and by $ 2.3 billion over the five years to 2028 –29.  
Receipts policy decisions over the forward estimates  
Total receipts in 2025–26 are broadly  unchanged since MYEFO as a result of net policy 
decisions. Over the five years to 2028 –29, policy decisions have decreased total receipts by 
$14.2 billion, which overwhelmingly reflects tax receipts measures. Key tax receipts 
measures include:  
• delivering new tax cuts to every Australian taxpayer from 1 July 2026 to provide further 
cost-of-living relief, return bracket creep and boost labour supply. This measure, which 
adds to the first round of tax cuts that commenced on 1 July 2024, is estimated to 
decrease receipts by $17.1 billion over the five years from 2024 –25. 
• strengthening the fairness and sustainability of Australia ’s tax system by extending and 
expanding tax compliance activities.  This measure is estimated to increase receipts by 
$3.2 billion and increase payments by $ 1.4 billion. The increase in payments includes 
$999.0 million in additional funding for the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), an 
increase in GST payments to the states and territories of $ 402.6 million and $ 31.0 million 
in unpaid superannuation to be disbursed to employees.  
• strengthening the sanctions available to the Tax Practitioners Board (TPB), modernising 
the registration framework for tax practitioners and providing funding to the TPB to 
undertake additional investigation and compliance activity targeting high -risk tax 
practitioners.  This measure is estimated to increase receipts by $ 47.0 million and 
increase payments by $ 27.4 million over the five years from 2024 –25.  
• pausing indexation on draught beer excise and excise -equivalent customs duty rates for 
a two-year period, from August 2025, and increasing support available under the 
existing Excise remission scheme for manufacturers of alcoholic beverages  and Wine 
Equalisation Tax Producer rebate by increasing the maximum remission or rebate cap to 
$400,000  per financial year, from 1 July 2026.  This measure is estimated to decrease 
receipts by $165.0  million over the five years from 2024 –25. 
• banning foreign purchases of established dwellings for a two-year period from 
1 April  2025, subject to limited exceptions, and implementing an audit program to target 
land banking by foreign buyers . This measure  will increase payments by $14.6 million  
in additional funding for the Australian Taxation Office and Treasury over the four  
years from 2025 –26 and decreas e receipts by $ 90.0 million over the five years from 
2024–  25 due to forgone revenue from foreign investment application fees.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  | Page 65 
• increasing the Medicare levy low -income thresholds by 4.7 per cent for singles, families, 
and seniors and pensioners from 1 July 2024. This means more than one million 
Australians on lower incomes will continue to be exempt from paying the Medicare 
levy or pay a reduced levy rate. This measure is estimated to decrease receipts by 
$648.0  million over the five years from 2024 –25.  
Since  MYEFO , policy decisions are expected to increase  non-tax receipts  by $0.2 billion  in 
2025–26, and by $0.9 billion over the five years to 2028 –29. This increase is largely driven by 
the standard non -tax revenue impacts of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listings , which 
partially offset expenditure impacts of these listings .  
Further details of Government policy decisions are provided in Budget Paper No.  2, 
Budget  Measures 202 5–26.  
Receipts parameter and other variations over the forward estimates  
Parameter and other variations have increased total receipts since MYEFO by $ 7.0 billion in 
2025–26 and by $ 8.4 billion over five  years to 202 8–  29 (Table 3. 2). 
The change  in total receipts due to parameter and other variations since MYEFO  primarily 
reflects tax receipts, which have been revised up by $ 6.7 billion in 202 5–26 and up by 
$8.5 billion over five  years to 202 8–29.  
Excluding GST and policy decisions , tax receipts have been revised up  by $6.7 billion in 
2025–26 and $ 9.4 billion over the five years to 2028 –29. Higher employment and continuing 
strength in the labour market is the main  driver of the upgrade since MYEFO. Th is is 
supported in the near term by temporary strength in mining sector profits, leading to 
higher company tax receipts.  This is  partly offset by a downgraded outlook for excisable 
tobacco volumes across the forward estimates.   
Since  MYEFO , parameter and other variations are expected to increase  non-tax receipts by 
$0.3 billion in 202 5–26 and by $1.4 billion over the five  years to 202 8–29. This increase is 
driven by increases in the number  and value of funded benefit transfers to the 
Consolidated Revenue Fund from the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation , and  in 
anticipated lodgments of unclaimed monies from financial institutions . This increase is 
partially offset by lower -than -expected Commonwealth Government interest earnings due 
to an  anticipated decrease in short -term interest rates .  
Further information on expected receipts is provided in Statement  4: Revenue.  Analysis of 
the sensitivity of the receipts estimates to changes in the economic outlook is provided in 
Statement  7: Forecasting Performance and Sensitivity Analysis.   
Payments estimates  
Since MYEFO, total projected payments have increased by $ 2.1 billion in 2025–26 and 
decreased  by $7.3 billion over five  years to 202 8–29 (see Table 3.3) . Real payments growth 
over the seven year s to 2028–29 is expected to average 1.7 per cent per year and over the 
five years to 2028 –  29 it is expected to average 2.7 per cent per year.     | Budget Paper No. 1

Payment policy decisions over the forward estimates  
New policy decisions since MYEFO have increased total payments by $7.1  billion in 
2025–  26 and by $20.7 billion over five years from 2024 –25 to 2028 –29.  
Major policy decisions since MYEFO that have increased payments include:  
• funding to improve access to affordable health care, including extending eligibility for 
bulk billing incentives to all Australians, the creation of additional incentives for 
practices to become fully bulk billed, supporting the digital health reform agend a and 
ensuring the Medica re Benefits Schedule is modern and clinically appropriate, which is 
expected to increase payments by $8.4 billion over five years from 2024 –25. Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  | Page 67 
• funding for new road and rail infrastructure priority projects within the Infrastructure 
Investment Program, which is expected to increase payments by $1.8 billion over five 
years from 2024 –25. 
• funding for new and amended listings on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, 
Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Stoma Appliance Scheme and Take Home 
Naloxone program, which is expected to increase payments by $1.8 billion over five 
years from 2024 –25. 
• funding to continue energy bill rebates of $75 per quarter for all Australian households 
and eligible small businesses until 31 December 2025, which is expected to increase 
payments by $1.8 billion in 2025 –26. 
• additional funding for the National Health Reform Agreement in 2025 –26, which is 
expected to increase payments by $1.8  billion in 2025 –26. 
• funding to lower the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme general patient co -payment from 
$31.60  to $25.00 on 1 January 2026 , which is expected to increase payments by 
$784.6  million over four years from 2025 –26. 
• additional funding for the Better and Fairer Schools Agreement, which is expected to 
increase payments by $407.5 million over four years from 2025 –26.  
Since MYEFO, further reductions in spending on consultants, contractors and labour hire 
have been applied, which will achieve savings of $718.8 million in 2028 –29.  
Payment parameter and other variations over the forward estimates  
Parameter and other variations since MYEFO have decreased payments by $5.0  billion in 
2025–26 and by $28.0  billion over five  years from 2024 –25 to 2028 –29.  
This is primarily driven by lower estimated payments  for the NDIS, the Commonwealth 
Debt Management program and on road and rail transport projects under the 
Infrastructure Investment Program. These are partially offset by higher estimated payments 
related to the Aged Care Services program and Financial Supp ort for People with Disability 
program.  
Major decreases in payments from parameter and other variations since MYEFO include:  
• payments related to road and rail transport projects under the Infrastructure Investment 
Program, which are expected to decrease by $255.7 million in 2025 –26 and by 
$4.6 billion over five years to 2028 –29, largely reflecting revised project delivery 
schedu les and the application of a slippage adjustment. Slippage is a usual occurrence 
for large and complex capital infrastructure projects. The slippage adjustment takes into 
account historical experience, including the timing of states claiming payments again st 
milestones and the impact of revised project delivery schedules for some projects. The 
decrease is partially offset by the Government ’s additional investments in road and rail 
priority projects.   | Budget Paper No. 1

• payments related to the NDIS, which are expected to decrease by $954.0 million in 
2025–  26 and $3.9 billion over five years to 2028 –29, largely reflecting lower spending 
over the year to date, and hence lower forecast NDIS payments.  
• payments related to Commonwealth debt management, which are expected to decrease 
by $424.4  million in 2025 –26 and $3.3 billion over five years to 2028 –29, largely reflecting 
lower forecasts for interest rates.  
• payments related to the Support for Seniors program, which are expected to decrease by 
$343.7 million in 2025 –26 and $1.6 billion over five years to 2028 –29, largely reflecting 
lower -than -expected indexation rates for the Age Pension due to downwards revisions 
to the near -term outlook for inflation.  
• payments related to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which are expected to 
decrease by $5.6 million in 2025 –26 and $671.0 million over five years to 2028 –29, largely 
reflecting updated pharmaceutical pricing assumptions, and lower -than -expected 
prescription volumes for some high -cost listings.  
• payments related to the Research and Development Tax Incentive program, which are 
expected to increase by $55.8 million in 2025 –26 and decrease by $640.6 million over five 
years to 2028 –29, largely reflecting lower -than -expected numbers of claims.  
• payments related to the Job Seeker Income Support program, which are expected to 
decrease by $136.7  million in 2025 –26 and $616.3 million over five years to 2028 –29, 
largely reflecting lower -than -expected indexation rates, due to downwards revisions to 
the near -term outlook for inflation, and downward revisions to unemployment 
beneficiary recipient numbers, reflecting a stronger labour market.  
• payments related to the Student Payments program, which are expected to decrease by 
$134.0  million in 2025 –26 and $476.8 million over five years to 2028 –29, largely reflecting 
lower -than -expected Youth Allowance (Student) recipient numbers.  
Major increases in payments from parameter and other variations since MYEFO include:  
• payments related to the Aged Care Services program, which are expected to increase by 
$906.1 million in 2025 –26 and $3.1 billion over five years to 2028 –29. This is largely due 
to increased funding for wages as a result of the Fair Work Commission ’s decision to 
increase minimum award wages for aged care nurses from 1 March 2025, and increased 
funding for the Home Care Packages program due to increased package use. The 
budget impact of this increase is partially offset by funding provisioned in the 
Contingen cy Reserve for wage increases for aged care nurses.  
• payments related to the Financial Support for People with Disability program, which 
are expected to increase by $408.5 million in 2025 –26 and $2.4  billion over five years to 
2028–29, reflecting stronger growth in the Disability Support Pension recipient numbers 
and average payment rates.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  | Page 69 
• payments related to the Medical Benefits program, which are expected to increase by 
$18.2 million in 2025 –26 and $668.1 million over five years to 2028 –29, largely reflecting 
higher than expected demand for medical services and more patients than expected 
reaching the Extended Medicare Safety Net Threshold.  
• payments related to the National Partnership Payments – Natural Disaster Relief 
program, which are expected to increase by $214.9 million in 2025 –26 and $487.7 million 
over five years to 2028 –29, largely reflecting updated estimates received from states and 
territories for payments and changes in the timing of payments.  
• payments related to the Australian Screen and Digital Game Production Incentive 
program, which are expected to increase by $46.0 million in 2025 –26 and $478.8 million 
over five years to 2028 –29, largely reflecting an increase in both the quantity and value 
of large budget project applications expected to be certified.  
Consistent with past budgets, the underlying cash balance has been improved by regular 
draw down of the conservative bias allowance . Details in Statement  5: Expenses and Net 
Capital Investment.   
Headline cash balance  
The headline cash balance adjusts the underlying cash balance to include net cash flows 
from investments in financial assets for policy purposes (IFAPPs). This includes Specialist 
Investment Vehicles which invest in projects that deliver public value and a  financial return 
to taxpayers. For example, Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) loans and equity 
investments impact the headline cash balance but not the underlying cash balance. 
Table  3.4 details differences between the underlying and headline cash b alance estimates.  
A headline cash deficit of $ 65.2 billion (2.3 per cent of GDP) is estimated in 2025 –26, 
compared  to an estimated deficit of $70.3 billion  at MYEFO. The improvement is 
predominantly driven by the improvement in the underlying cash balance.  The headline 
cash balance  moderat es to a deficit of $ 55.9 billion (1.7 per cent of GDP) in 2028–29. 
Estimated net cash outflows for IFAPPs decreased by $ 4.7 billion over the four years to 
2027–28 compared to MYEFO. This  is largely  due to:  
• A $2.8 billion decrease in outflows for the CEFC, reflecting revised timelines across both 
Rewiring the Nation and the CEFC ’s other activities.  
• A $776 million decrease in outflows for the Help to Buy scheme , reflecting revisions to 
the rollout  of the program. This is partially offset by addition al investment to increase 
income and property price caps under the program.  Further information can be found 
in the 2025 –26 Budget measure Housing support . 
• A $317 million decrease in outflows for the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, 
due to proponent -driven changes to loan utilisation.   | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 70 | Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  
The decrease in outflows for IFAPPs over the four years to 2027 –28 is partially offset by  an 
additional $ 1.4 billion in cash outflows from the National Reconstruction Fund. This results 
from  an updated investment pipeline which will see more investments made in 2024 –25 
and 2025 –26. 
Net cash flows for a number of programs listed in Table 3. 4 reflect the inclusion of funding 
provided by the Government in a prior update . These funds were previously captured 
within the ‘Net other ’ line and are now incorporated in their relevant line items. These 
include:  
• $5.5 billion over the five years from  2024–25 for the Help to Buy scheme . Those amounts 
are now itemised against Housing Australia, taking into account the revisions to the 
rollout and the additional investment .  
• $1.6 billion over the four  years from 2025 –26 to recapitalise the CEFC  to invest in 
renewable energy, energy efficiency and low emissions technologies. Further 
information can be found in the 2025 –26 Budget measure Strengthening the Clean Energy 
Finance Corporation.  
• $1.4 billion over  three  years from 2024 –25 to provide additional equity funding to 
NBN  Co as part of the upgrade of the remaining 622,000 NBN premises on the national 
fibre -to-the-node (FTTN) network.  Further information can be found in the 2025 –26 
Budget measure Building Australia ’s Future – completing the NBN fibre upgrades.  
• $570  million in 2024 –25 for a budget support loan to Papua New Guinea  (PNG)  to 
address the PNG Government ’s estimated 2024 budget shortfall , with associated 
repayments total ling $128 million within the forward estimates to 202 8–29. Further

Medium -term projections  
The underlying cash balance is expected to return to  balance in 2035–36 (Chart  3.3). The 
change in the underlying cash balance over the medium -term since MYEFO primarily 
reflects the new tax cuts for all Australian taxpayers.  
By 30 June  2036, gross debt is expected to be 31.9  per cent of GDP (Chart 3. 4). Compared to 
the PEFO, gross debt is lower every year of the projection period.  
Total receipts as a share of GDP are expected to increase from 25.3 per  cent of GDP in 
2028–  29 to 26.8  per cent of GDP in 2035 –36. Total payments as a share of GDP are expected 
to increase from 26.4  per cent in 2028 –29 to 26.8  per cent in 2035 –36 (Chart  3.5).

Payments over the medium term  
Payments are expected to be 0.1  percentage points of GDP higher than at MYEFO in 2034–
35 (Chart  3.7). Nominal GDP is expected to be lower than was project ed at MYEFO, 
increasing payments relative to the size the economy.  
The fastest growing major payments over the medium  term are interest on government 
debt, the NDIS, defence, hospitals payments, medical benefits payments, the Child Care 
Subsidy and aged care payments (Chart  3.8).  
Growth in some major payments over the Budget projection period  (2025–26 to 2035 –36) 
has changed compared to MYEFO (2024 –25 to 2034 –35).  
• Interest payments growth is expected to average 9.5 per cent per year over the 
projection period compared to 10.9 per cent at MYEFO.  This reflects the impact of a 
reduction in debt in the early years of the forward estimates period, partially offset by 
the change in the underlying cash balance . 
• Commonwealth funded hospital payments growth is expected to average 5.9 per cent 
per year over the projection period compared to 6.5  per cent at MYEFO. This reflects the 
impact of the uplift to the funding contribution for the National Health Reform 
Agreement in 2025 –26. This increases hospital payments at the start of the projection 
period, resulting in slower growth over the decade.  
• Child Care Subsidy payments growth is expected to average 5.1 per cent over the 
projection period compared to 5.5 per cent at MYEFO , reflecting updated projections of 
usage in the medium  term .   Budget Paper No. 1  |

The Government ’s balance sheet  
The balance sheet measures the value of the Government ’s assets and liabilities. Changes in 
the balance sheet reflect movements in the underlying cash balance, additional balance 
sheet commitments, and market valuation effects , including from changes in yields.  
Different balance sheet metrics measure different groupings of assets and liabilities.  
• Gross debt  measures the face value of Australian  Government Securities (AGS) on 
issue. This is the amount that the Government pays back to investors at maturity, 
independent of fluctuations in market prices.  
• Net debt  is measured at market value and incorporates specific financial assets and 
liabilities and provides a broader measure of the financial obligations of 
the Government than gross debt.  
• Net financial worth  is the sum of all financial assets less all liabilities. The assets of the 
Future Fund and the public sector superannuation liability that the Future  Fund will 
finance are included in net financial worth.  
• Net worth  is the sum of all assets less all liabilities. It includes non -financial assets such 
as buildings and plant, equipment, and infrastructure.  
Further information on definitions is available in Statement  9: Australian  Government Budget 
Financial Statements.  
Gross debt estimates and projections  
The Government ’s responsible budget management is lowering gross debt -to-GDP  
compared to the PEFO in every year of the forward estimates period and medium term.  
Gross debt is estimated to be $177 billion lower in 2024 –25 than estimated in the PEFO.  
Gross debt is estimated to be 35.5 per cent of GDP at 30  June  2026  (Table 3. 5), 0.5 percentage 
points  and $ 6 billion lower than estimated at  MYEFO and 9.2 percentage points and 
$147 billion lower than the PEFO.  
By the end of the forward estimates, gross debt is lower than MYEFO in nominal terms , 
driven by the improved budget position.  The slight increase in debt -to-GDP  since MYEFO  
reflects  the impact of  downward revisions to nominal GDP .  
Gross debt is expected to peak  at 37.0 per cent of GDP at 30 June 2030 , 7.9 percentage points 
lower than the forecast peak at the PEFO.   Budget Paper No. 1  |

Page 78 | Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  
Interest payments  
Interest payments have decreased since  MYEFO , driven by lower  yields  and a lower 
financing task from the improved budget position.  Over the forward estimates, bond yields 
are assumed to remain fixed at a recent average of daily spot rates at the time of the budget 
update. Since MYEFO , the assumed weighted average cost of borrowing for issuance of 
Treasury Bonds in the forward estimates has decreased  from 4. 4 to 4.3 per cent, broadly 
reflecting movements  in yields globally.  This remains higher than the weighted average 
yield of 2.2 per cent at the 2022 PEFO.  
Total interest payments are estimated to be 1.0 per cent of GDP in 202 5–26, unchanged from 
the estimate at  MYEFO . Interest payments are estimated to peak at 1.6 per cent of GDP in 
2032–33. By 2034–35, interest payments are broadly unchanged from the  2024–25 MYEFO . 
Statement  6: Debt Statement contains further information on yield assumptions and interest 
payments.  Statement  7: Forecasting Performance and  Sensitivity Analysis  contains information 
on the impact on the underlying cash balance and gross debt if the future trajectory for 
yields is higher or lower than assumed.   
Net debt estimates and projections  
Net debt is estimated to be 21.5 per cent of GDP ($ 620.3  billion) at 30  June  2026 (Table  3.5); 
11.5 percentage points  lower  than estimated at the PEFO  and 0.2 percentage  points higher 
than estimated  at MYEFO.  Net debt relative to GDP is expected to be higher in the forward 
estimates compared to MYEFO , reflect ing a reduction in Future Fund  investments , loans 
and plac ements  and the impact of lower yields o n AGS .

Net worth is estimated to be minus 21.6 per cent of GDP (minus $ 621.8  billion) at 
30 June  2026 (Table  3.5), compared  with the estimate of minus 22.0 per cent of GDP 
(minus  $628.9 billion) at MYEFO. Net worth is projected to deteriorate to minus 
22.3 per cent of GDP at 30  June  2029 before improving over the medium term.  
The improvement  in net worth and net financial worth over the forward estimates period 
relative to MYEFO largely reflects an increase in assets held by the  Future Fund .  
Net worth and net financial worth as a share of the economy improve  over the medium 
term as debt -to-GDP is reduced.    | Budget Paper No. 1

Fiscal impacts of the net zero transformation  
Climate change and global climate action will have profound impacts on the economy, 
reshaping Australia ’s industry mix and requiring effective mitigation and adaptation to 
manage climate impacts like more severe floods and bushfires. At the same time, the net 
zero transformation presents new opportunities for Australia ’s industries, regions and 
communities. Achieving Australia ’s emissions reduction commitments and realising the 
opportunities that accompany the transition will require significant investment by 
governments and the private sector.   
The Government is committed to improving the transparency of public money committed 
to climate action. It recognises the importance of identifying, disclosing, and tracking net 
zero spending in improving Australia ’s response to climate change and aligning with 
international efforts. Accounting for net zero spending comprehensively is challenging as it 
cuts across many portfolios, ranging from energy to health. Existing budget systems  do not 
readily facilitate reporting net zero spending on established progr ams. For this reason, 
reporting of net zero spending focuses on new  measures.  
Australia ’s classification approach  
The 2025 –26 Budget continues the practice introduced in the 2022 –23 October Budget of 
transparently reporting new climate -related spending. It adopts the five -part classification 
outlined in detail in the 2024 –25 Budget:  
• Reducing emissions in Australia ’s energy system and broader economy  
• Strengthening net zero industries and skills  
• Adapting to climate change and improving climate and disaster resilience  
• International climate leadership  
• Building Australian Government climate capability  
In the 2025 –26 Budget, new measures from 2024 –25 MYEFO are also reported, to provide a 
comprehensive update on net zero spending since the 2024 –25 Budget.  
Where policies contribute to multiple net zero objectives , spending is classified into the 
most appropriate category based on its primary purpose. Policies that  contribute indirectly 
to net zero objectives  are not included in this classification approach.  
  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  | Page 81 
The 2025 –26 Budget leverages established delivery vehicles, such as the Clean Energy 
Finance Corporation and Rewiring the Nation program, to invest in the next horizon of 
emissions reduction technologies and additional renewable energy capacity. Additional 
investme nts in these programs are included as new spending this Budget. The Government 
has also made significant new allocations from within existing funds, such as the 
$750  million for green metals, $500 million for clean energy technology manufacturing 
capabilities and $250 million for low carbon liquid fuels identified from the Future Made in 
Australia Innovation Fund. These are not included as new spending.  
This reporting framework maintains alignment with international best practice and recent 
budgets. It will continue to evolve over time as the Government works with and learns 
from reporting entities and partners around the world.  Australian Government green 
bonds have contributed to financing programs that support climate mitigation, climate 
adaptation and improved environmental outcomes.  
Reporting climate -related spending categories as part of the budget process  is 
complementary to the reporting associated with the issuance of green bonds (see Box 3. 3).   | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 82 | Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  
Box 3. 3: Financing climate programs through green bonds  
Green bonds help mobilise capital toward public projects to drive Australia ’s 
net zero transformation and support Australia ’s environmental goals.  
In June 2024, the Government issued the first Green Treasury Bond. The $7 billion 
issuance attracted strong demand with more than $22  billion in bids from 
105 investor institutions, of which 17 were new to Australian Government 
syndicated issues.  The Australian Office of Financial Management and market 
participants estimated a green premium of approximately 2 basis points f rom the 
inaugural issuance.  
The Treasury released the first Green Treasury Bond Allocation and Impact Report 
in February 2025. This report presents allocation data for eligible projects financed 
by green bonds in 2022 –23 and 2023 –24, and the climate and environmental impact 
of these projects. Green bonds reporting represents a new type of disclosure and 
increases transparency for the Government ’s climate and environmental programs.  
Of the $7.0 billion raised, $2.5 billion has been allocated to eligible projects in  
2022–23, and $2.9 billion has been allocated to eligible projects in 2023 –24. The 
remaining $1.6 billion will be allocated to eligible projects in future years 
(Chart  3.11). 
Government programs financed through green bonds deliver electric vehicle  
chargers through the Driving the Nation  Fund , support climate change action in the 
Indo -Pacific region and protect the Great Barrier Reef  (Chart 3. 12). Green Treasury 
Bond proceeds  have contributed to a range of climate and environmental impacts, 
including:  
• 4,600  GWh of expected renewable energy generation;  
• 103.4  km of electric rail track built or upgraded;  
• 5,564 hectares of koala habitat improved and managed.

New net zero spending measures  
Table 3. 6 sets out $4.3 billion in new  net zero spending commitments over the forward 
estimates period and $6.9 billion over the medium term , across 2024 –25 MYEFO and this 
Budget.  This follows  net zero spending commitments of $24.3  billion (over the medium 
term) in the 2024–25 Budget,  climate -related spending of $4.6  billion (to 2030) committed in 
the 2023–24 Budget and the $24.9  billion (to 2030) committed in the 2022 –23 October 
Budget.  
Classification of spending is informed by the net zero spending framework. The total 
commitment includes spending, balance sheet and tax expenditure measures and therefore 
presents a broader view than the impact on the underlying cash balance.  
Reporting new net zero spending measures supports transparency around the fiscal 
impacts of climate change and the net zero transformation. However, it does not provide 
a complete summary of climate action. Only measures that entail funding commitments or 
forgone  revenue (such as tax concessions) are captured .    | Budget Paper No. 1

Appendix A: Other fiscal aggregates  
Accrual aggregates  
Accrual accounting records income and costs at the time they are incurred. Cash 
accounting records income and costs at the time of the associated actual cash flow. 
Differences in estimates arise where there is a difference between the timing of an activity 
and the associated cash flow.  
Net operating balance estimates  
The net operating balance is an accrual measure, reflecting revenue minus expenses. 
It excludes the fiscal impact of the Australian  Government ’s net new capital expenditure.  
The net operating balance is expected to be a deficit  of $45.2 billion ( 1.6 per cent of GDP) in 
2024–25 (Table  3.7). It is expected to be a deficit of $ 35.4 billion ( 1.2 per cent of GDP) in 
2025–26, compared to an expected deficit of $ 41.4 billion at MYEFO.   
Fiscal balance  
The fiscal balance is the accrual equivalent of the underlying cash balance and equals the 
net operating balance less net new capital investment.  
The fiscal balance is expected to be a defici t of $50.6 billion ( 1.8 per cent of GDP) in 202 4–25 
(Table  3.7). It is expected to be a deficit  of $44.2 billion ( 1.5 per cent of GDP) in 202 5–26, 
compared to an expected deficit of $ 49.7 billion  at MYEFO.

Revenue estimates  
Revenue is the accrual accounting equivalent of cash -based receipts. Changes in revenue 
are generally driven by the same factors as receipts. Revenue amounts can be higher or 
lower than the cash equivalents as they include amounts that a taxpayer is liable to pay but 
has not paid. The differences between the  accrual and cash amounts generally reflect 
timing differences.  
Total revenue since MYEFO has been revised up by $ 7.1 billion  in 202 5–26 and by 
$1.9 billion  over four years from 202 4–25 to 202 7–28.  
Expense estimates  
Expenses are the accrual accounting equivalent of cash -based payments.  
Total expenses since MYEFO have been revised up by $1.1  billion  in 2025–26 and by 
$1.1 billion  over four  years from 2024 –25 to 2027 –28.  
Movements in expenses over the forward estimates period are broadly consistent with 
movements in cash payments. The key exceptions include:  
• the NDIS program, where there is an expected time lag between the receipt of 
reasonable and necessary support services and the lodgment of claims relating to 
those  services . 
• superannuation benefits programs (civilian and military), where there is a timing 
difference with the expense accruing during employment and cash payments occurring 
during retirement . 
• purchases of non -financial assets, which are included in cash payments but not in 
accrual expenses. The expense estimates include depreciation of non-financial  assets 
rather than recognising the impact at the time of purchase.  
Detailed information on expenses can be found in Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital 
Investment.   
   | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 88 | Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook  
Structural budget balance  
The structural budget balance estimate adjusts the underlying cash balance to remove the 
estimated effects of cyclical factors that have a temporary impact on receipts and payments. 
These factors include deviations in commodity prices and economic activity from their 
long-run levels. The structural budget balance can provide insight into the sustainability of 
fiscal settings.  
The structural balance is estimated rather than observed, so it is sensitive to the 
assumptions and parameters that underpin it. Commodity price volatility has increased the 
uncertainty around the estimate.  
The structural budget position is expected  to return to deficit in 2024–25 (Chart  3.13). The 
deficit is expected to  reach  around  1.4 per cent of GDP in 2025–26. It average s 1.0 per cent 
of GDP over the forward estimates , a 0.4 percentage point improvement over the same 
period at the time of the PEFO . Thereafter , the structural budget position  is expected  to 
gradually improve towards balance  over the medium term . The structural budget balance 
was estimated to remain in deficit at the end of the medium -term in 2032–33 at the time of  
the PEFO.

Note:  The approach separating the budgetary impact of cyclical factors from structural measures follows 
the methodology detailed in Treasury Working Paper 2013 –01. Cyclical factors measure the 
estimated impact on the underlying cash balance from automatic stabilisers and cyclical 
movements in asset and commodity prices. Temporary fiscal measures comprise direct economic 
and health support measures initiated between the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic and the 
2022 – 23 October  Budget. Underspends in these direct economic and health support measures  
are not captured in the derivation of the structural budget balance, which may alter the  structural 
budget balance estimate  in those years .  
  
Statement 4: Revenue  | Page 89 Statement  4:  
Revenue  
The upgrade to receipts over the forward estimates is much smaller than in recent Budgets.  
In this Budget, it is around one sixth of the average of the last five budget  updates . The 
upgrade i s concentrated in the near term , with  upgrades to income tax  receip ts being 
partially offset by downgrades to excise and customs duty . 
Since MYEFO,  tax receipts excluding GST and policy decisions  have increas ed by 
$6.7 billion in 202 5–26 and $ 9.4 billion over the five years from 2024 –25 to 2028 –29.  
The Government will deliver new personal income tax cuts to every Australian taxpayer 
from 1 July 2026, adding to the tax cuts that have been rolling out since 1  July 2024.  
Primarily driven by the new tax cuts, policy decisions taken since MYEFO decrease tax 
receipts by $15.1  billion over the five years from 2024 –25 to 2028 –29.  
Higher employment and continuing strength in the labour market is the main driver  of the 
upgrade s to tax receipts  since MYEFO . This is supported in the near term by temporar y 
strength in mining sector profits , leading to higher  company  tax receipts .  
These  upgrades  are partly offset  by a downgrade  to the  outlook for excisable tobacco 
volumes across the forward estimates. Lower non-mining company profits  also contribute 
to lower company tax  estimates in the later years . 
The revenue outlook continues to be exposed to the underlying economic risks. The global 
economic outlook remains uncertain and volatile, particularly from the escalation  in trade 
tensions. This uncertainty  poses risks for exports and global commodity prices.  
The tax -to-GDP ratio is expected to be 23.5  per cent of GDP in 2025 –26 and then fall to 
23.4 per cent of GDP by the end of the forward estimates , following the delivery of the 
Government ’s new tax cuts  for every Australian taxpayer .

Overview  
Total  receipts are expected to be $735.4  billion in  2025–26, growing  to $840.8  billion in 
2028–29. Since MYEFO, total receipts have been revised up $ 6.9 billion in 2025 –26 and 
down by  $5.8 billion over the five  years from 2024 –25 to 2028 –29.  
Tax receipts are the main component of total receipts and are expected to be $676.1  billion 
in 2025–26, growing  to $778.3  billion in 2028–29. Income taxes are the largest contributor to 
growth  in tax receipts . The t ax-to-GDP ratio is expected to be  23.5 per cent in 202 5–26 and 
falls to 23.4 per cent of GDP by the end of the forward estimates  following the delivery of 
the Government ’s new tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer .

Tax receipts outlook  
Since MYEFO, tax receipts excluding GST and policy decisions have been revised up by 
$9.4 billion over the five years from  2024–25 to 2028 –29, mainly reflecting higher personal 
income tax and superannuation fund taxes. The upgrade to  total  tax receipts in this Budget 
is small and concentrated in the near -term.  
Higher employment and continuing strength in the labour market is the main  driver of the 
upgrade  to tax receipts . Excluding policy decisions , personal income tax  receipts  have been 
upgraded by $9.9 billion and superannuation fund tax  receipts  by $9.7 billion  over the 
five years from 2024 –25 to 2028 –29. This is  supported in the near term by  higher company 
tax, reflecting  temporarily  stronger mining sector profits.  
These upgrades are partially offset  by lower tobacco excise receipts, which have been 
downgraded by $6.9 billion over five years from 2024 –25 to 2028 –29 due to a weaker 
outlook for excisable tobacco volumes. Despite  a near -term upgrade, c ompany tax  has also 
been downgraded by $1.9 billion over the five years from 2024 –25 to 2028 –29 due to  lower 
expected non-mining company profits  in later years .  
Policy decisions taken since MYEFO decrease  tax receipts by $ 259.1  million  in 202 5–26 and 
$15.1 billion over the five years from  2024–25 to 2028–29. Policy decisions in this Budget 
focus on reforms to provide cost of living relief, improve tax integrity  and modernise the 
tax system . Key policy decisions include:  
• Personal Income Tax – new tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer  
• Personal Income Tax – increasing the Medicare levy low -income thresholds  
• Strengthening tax  integrity

Variations in receipts estimates  
Since MYEFO, total receipts have been revised up by $ 6.9 billion in 202 5–26 and revised 
down by $5.8 billion over the five years from 202 4–25 to 202 8–29. Table  4.2 reconciles the

Since MYEFO, parameter and other variations have increased total receipts by $ 7.0 billion 
in 202 5–26 and $8.4 billion over the five years from 2024 –25 to 2028 –29. Policy decisions 
decrease  total receipts by $ 103.0 million  in 2025–26 and $ 14.2 billion over the five years 
from 2024–25 to 2028 –29. The change  to the outlook  of total receipts overwhelmingly reflects 
changes to the outlook of tax receipts.  
Tax receipts estimates  
Tax receipts have been revised up by $ 6.4 billion in 202 5–26 and down by $6.6 billion over 
the five years from 2024 –25 to 2028 –29 since MYEFO .

Changes in the outlook for individual heads of revenue are explained in more detail below.  
Individuals and other withholding taxes  
Since MYEFO, total individuals and other withholding tax receipts have been revised up by 
$1.3 billion in 202 5–26 and revised  down by $ 6.5 billion over the five years from 2024–25 to 
2028–29. Individuals and other withholding taxes have been revised down from 2026–27 
with the delivery of the Government ’s new tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer.  
Excluding new policy decisions, individuals and other withholding tax receipts have been 
revised up by $ 1.5 billion in 202 5–26 and $ 9.9 billion over the five years from 2024–25 to 
2028–29. This reflects a stronger outlook for employment  and wage s growth .  
New tax policy measures announced since MYEFO are expected to decre ase individuals 
and other withholding tax receipts by $179.1 million in 202 5–26 and $16.4 billion over the 
five years from 2024–25 to 2028–29.  
Fringe benefits  tax 
Since MYEFO, fringe benefits tax receipts have been revised up by $ 50.0 million in 
2025–26 and $ 240.0 million over the five years from 2024–25 to 2028–29. This reflects the 
stronger outlook for employment .  
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 98 | Statement 4: Revenue  
Company tax  
Since MYEFO, company tax receipts have been revised up by $4.5 billion in 2025–26 
and revised  down  by $800.0 million  over the five years from 2024–25 to 2028–29. 
Excluding new policy decisions, company tax receipts have been revised up by $ 4.5 billion 
in 2025–26 and revised down by $ 1.9 billion over the five years from 2024 –25 to 2028 –29. 
The upgrade in the near term reflects a stronger outlook for mining sector profits, reflecting 
higher near -term commodity prices. Company tax receipts have been downgraded in 
2027–28 and 2028 –29, driven by a weaker outlook for non -mining sector profits.  
New tax policy measures announced since MYEFO are expected to decrease company 
tax receipts by $ 32.5 million in 202 5–26 and increase company tax receipts by  $1.1 billion 
over the five years from 2024–25 to 2028–29. 
Superannuation fund taxes  
Since MYEFO, superannuation fund tax receipts have been revised up by $2.4 billion in 
2025–26 and $ 9.7 billion over the  five years  from 2024–25 to 2028–29. The upgrade to 
superannuation fund taxes reflects higher -than -expected  current year collections , higher 
contributions due to the  strength in employment  and an increase in tax from earnings on 
investments .  
Superannuation fund taxes are highly volatile from one year to the next, primarily due to 
year -to-year changes in  tax from earnings on investments and the consequential impact on 
the timing of tax payments.  
Petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT)  
Since MYEFO, PRRT receipts have been revised up by $100.0 million  in 2025–26 and 
$750.0  million over the five years from 202 4–25 to 202 8–29. The  upgrade  is primarily due to  
a higher  assumed oil price .  
Goods and services tax (GST)  
Since MYEFO, GST receipts have been revised up by $5.8 million  in 2025–26 and revised 
down by $492.8 million over the five years from 2024–25 to 2028 –29.  
Excluding new policy decisions, GST receipts  have been revised down by $0.3 million in 
2025–26 and $ 895.8 m illion over the five years from 2024–25 to 2028 –29. This primarily  
reflects weaker -than -expected price pressures in the dwelling construction industry . 
New tax policy measures announced since MYEFO are expected to increase  GST receipts 
by $6.1 million in 202 5–26 and $403.0 million over  the five years from 2024–25 to 2028 –29.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 4: Revenue  | Page 99 
Excise and customs duty  
Since MYEFO, total excise and customs duty receipts have been revised down by 
$1.7 billion in 2025–26 and $ 8.6 billion over the five years from 2024–25 to 2028 –29.  
Excluding new policy decisions, excise and customs duty receipts have been revised down 
by $1.7 billion in 2025–26 and $ 8.5 billion over the five years from 2024–25 to 2028 –29. The 
downgrade  overwhelmingly reflects the significant downward revision to tobacco excise 
receipts. This is due to persistently  weaker -than -expected collections  and a weaker outlook 
for excisable tobacco volumes  over the forward estimates.  The Government has provided 
further funding in this Budget to combat the trade of illicit tobacco.  
Policy decisions are expected to decrease  excise and customs duty receipts by $ 10.0 million 
in 2025–26 and $125.0  million over the five years from 2024–25 to 2028 –29. 
The 202 5–26 Budget estimates continue to include provision for the Australia European 
Union Free Trade Agreement, which has not been finalised. This provision is assumed to 
impact customs duty receipts. No other Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) that are currently 
under n egotiation are expected to have a material impact on revenue over the forward 
estimates. A full list of FTAs currently under negotiation is available on the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade website.  
Other taxes  
Other taxes encompass a range of sources of receipts, including visa application charges, 
major bank levy, luxury car tax, wine equalisation tax and agricultural levies.  
Since MYEFO, other tax receipts have been revised down  by $140.6  million in 202 5–26 and 
$843.0 million over the five years from 202 4–25 to 202 8–29. Policy decisions  are expected to 
decrease other tax receipts by $ 43.6 million in 2025–26 and $ 95.9 million over the five years 
from 2024–25 to 202 8–29.  
Non–tax receipts estimates  
Since MYEFO, non-tax receipts are expected to increase by $0.5  billion in 2025 –26 and by 
$2.3 billion over the five years from 2024 –25 to 2028 –29. 
Parameter and other variations are expected to increase non -tax receipts by $0.3  billion 
in 2025–26 and by $1.4 billion over the five years to 2028 –29. This increase is driven by 
increases in the number and value of funded benefit transfers to the Consolidated Revenue 
Fund from the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation, and in anticipated lodgments 
of unclaimed monies from financial institutions. In addition, non -tax receipts have been 
revised up by $1.5 billion in 2028 –29 to account for the differences between the projection 
methodology at MYEFO and the forward estimate in this Budget. This inc rease is partially 
offset by lower -than -expected Commonwealth Government interest earnings due to an 
anticipated decrease in short -term interest rates.  
Policy decisions are expected to increase non -tax receipts by $0.2  billion in 2025 –26, and by 
$0.9 billion over the five years to 2028 –29. This increase is largely driven by the standard

Variations in revenue estimates  
The revenue estimates are the accrual accounting equivalent of the cash -based receipts 
estimates. Changes in revenue are generally driven by the same factors as receipts.  
Revenues are usually higher than the cash equivalents because the amounts are generally 
recognised when they are owed rather than when they are paid. The differences between 
the accrual and cash amounts therefore generally reflect payment timing difference s. 
Table  4.8 provides a reconciliation of the 202 5–26 Budget revenue estimates with those at 
the 202 4–25 Budget and MYEFO.

$5.2 billion over the five years from 202 4–25 to 202 8–29.  
The changes in the individual heads of revenue accrual estimates relative to MYEFO are 
shown in Tables  4.9 and 4.10, for 202 4–25 and 202 5–26, respectively. For the 5 -year accrual

Appendix A: Tax Expenditures  
This appendix contains an overview of Australian Government tax expenditures. Section  12 
of the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998  requires the publication of an overview of 
estimated tax expenditures.  
The Government published the 202 4–25 Tax Expenditures and Insights Statement (TEIS) 
on 17 December  2024. The TEIS provides an estimate of the revenue forgone from tax 
expenditures, along with distributional analysis on large tax expenditures and commonly 
utilised features of the tax system.  
Tax benchmarks represent a standard tax treatment that applies to similar taxpayers or 
types of activities. Policy approaches can apply a tax treatment different from a standard 
approach, which can give rise to positive or negative tax expenditures. The ch oice of 
benchmark unavoidably involves some judgment.  
Consistent with most OECD countries, estimates of tax expenditures reflect the extent to 
which they are used, similar to Budget estimates of outlays on demand -driven expenditure 
programs. This is known as the ‘revenue forgone ’ approach which, in practice, involves 
estimating the difference in revenue between the actual and benchmark tax treatments but, 
importantly, assuming taxpayer behaviour is the same in each circumstance. Revenue 
forgone estimates therefore do not indicate the revenue gain to the Budget  if a specific tax 
expenditure was abolished through policy change, as there may be significant changes in 
taxpayer behaviour.  
Care needs to be taken when comparing tax expenditures with direct expenditures as they 
may measure different things. In addition, estimates from different editions of previously 
released Statements are generally not directly comparable, because of changes  or 
modifications to —for example —benchmarks, individual tax expenditures, data used or 
modelling methodology.  
Table  A.4.1 lists the largest measured tax expenditures for 202 4–25 and several personal 
deduction categories. It is derived from the 202 4–25 TEIS and is based on economic 
parameters as at the publication of MYEFO. It does not include the impact of policy 
decisions, or changes in the economic outlook since then on tax expenditures. The TEIS is 
not a statement of policy intent.  
The 202 4–25 TEIS also contains distributional analysis on some features of the tax system, 
including deductions for individuals. The items in the deductions category are not tax

difference between tax paid with the deduction and tax that would have been paid if the

Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  | Page 111 Statement 5:  
Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
This Statement presents estimates of Australian Government general government sector 
expenses and net capital investment , disaggregated into various functions of government, 
on an  accrual accounting basis . The Government also reports spending on an underlying 
cash basis (including details about payments) in Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and Outlook . 
The 2025 –26 Budget delivers on the Government ’s economic plan, which is focused on 
finishing the fight against inflation, rolling out responsible cost -of-living relief and building 
a stronger economy and stronger budget. This Budget helps Australians now and builds 
Australia ’s future by delivering responsible cost -of-living relief, strengthening Medicare, 
making it easier to buy and rent a home, investing in every stage of education, and building 
a stronger economy.  
General government sector expenses are expected to be 27.3  per cent of GDP in 2025 –26, 
easing  to 26.8 per cent of GDP in 2028 –29, reflecting the Government ’s commitment to 
build a strong foundation for economic growth.  
Significant areas of expenditure in 2025 –26 will be in the social security and welfare  
(37.0  per cent of total expenses), health  (15.9 per cent of total expenses), education  
(6.9 per cent of total expenses) and defence  (6.6 per cent of total expenses) functions. 
Together, these functions account for around two thirds of all government expenses in 
2025 –26. 
Real growth in expenses over the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29 is expected to average 
1.2 per cent per  year. Significant contributions to real growth over the period are expected 
to occur in the social security and welfare, defence, health  and education  functions.  
Major expense trends over the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29 include movements in the 
following functions.  
Social security and welfare : the increase in expenses is largely due to the Government ’s 
ongoing investment in assistance to people with disability, both through the National 
Disability Insurance Scheme and the Disability Support Pension , and through funding 
under the Aged Care Services program. Expenses for services and payments, including 
aged care, child care and income support, are expected to increase over the period 2025 –26 
to 2028 –29 as more recipients access government services and funding is provi ded to meet 
pay increases for critical workers.  
Defence : the increase in expenses reflects that, under the 2024 National Defence Strategy and 
the 2024 Integrated Investment Program , the Government will invest in the acceleration of 
defence capabilities to defend Australia, deter actions against our national interests and 
respond to regional and global challenges.   
Page 112 | Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  Education : the increase in expenses reflects the Government ’s continued investment to 
improve  education outcomes at all stages, including support for schools,  higher education 
and vocational education programs. Expenditure is driven by more funding to states that 
have signed bilateral agreements under the Better an d Fairer Schools Agreement, and 
school student enrolment growth, including higher enrolment rates for students with 
disability. It also reflects increased funding for universities driven by additi onal 
Commonwealth supported study places at universities, including support for students 
from under -represented backgrounds and those studying at regional campuses.  
Mining, manufacturing and construction : the increase in expenses reflects the 
Government ’s continued investment in Australia ’s mining, manufacturing and 
construction industries. This includes expenses for the Critical Minerals Production Tax 
Incentive, which supports the downstream processing and refining of Australia ’s critical 
minerals.  
Fuel and energy : the increase in expenses in 2025 –26 for renewable energy investments 
reflects the Government ’s commitment to build Australia ’s renewable energy infrastructure 
through concessional loans made by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation under the 
Rewiring the Nation  Fund. In the 2025 –26 Budget, the Government is also extending the 
Energy Bill Relief Fund  to deliver cost -of-living relief to all Australian households and 
eligible businesses .  
Housing and community amenities : expenses reflect the Government ’s significant and 
continuing investments in building more homes and liveable communities, and ensuring 
Australians have access to safe, secure, and affordable housing . 
Figures in the tables and text, and the analysis of trends, are presented in nominal terms, 
except in circumstances where real values are explicitly stated.

In the 2025 –26 Budget, policy decisions are estimated to increase expenses by $16.2 billion 
over the four years from 2024 –25 to 2027 –28 compared with the 2024 –25 MYEFO.  
Economic parameters are estimated to decrease expenses by $1.8  billion over the four  years 
from 2024 –25 to 2027 –28 compared with the 2024 –25 MYEFO, largely reflecting lower 
projections for unemployment benefits on account of strong labour market outcomes.  
Since the 2024 –25 MYEFO, program specific parameter variations ($6.5 billion), variations 
associated with public debt interest ( -$2.6 billion), and other variations ( -$17.2 billion) have 
decreased expenses by $13.4 billion over the four years from 2024 –25 to 2027 –28. More 
detail about variations in payments, the cash equivalent of accrual -based expenses, can be

Box 5.1: Where does government spending go in 2025 –26? 
Government spending provides a wide range of services to the community. The 
most significant component of government spending relates to social security and 
welfare, with over one third of total expenses providing support to the aged, families 
with childre n, people with disabilities, veterans, carers and unemployed people.  
Around a sixth of government expenses occur in health, including spending on the 
Medicare Benefits Schedule and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.  
The Government also provides significant investment in education, supporting 
government and non -government schools, as well as higher education and 
vocational education and training.  
Defence is another significant component of government expenditure, providing 
capability to the Australian Defence Force to protect Australia ’s security and defend 
our national interests.

The top 20 payment programs in 2025 –26 are presented in Table  5.3.2. Although broadly 
similar to the top 20 expense programs, there are some differences in the timing of 
reporting between payments and expenses, and the reported payment figures include 
capital investment but exclude depreciation.

General government sector expenses  
General public services  
The general public services function includes expenses to support the organisation and 
operation of government. These expenses include those relating to the Parliament, the 
Governor -General, the conduct of elections, the collection of taxes and management of 
public funds and debt, assistance to developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve 
sustainable development (particularly countries in the Pacific region), contributions to 
international organisations and foreign affairs.  
The general public services function also includes expenses related to:  
• research in areas not otherwise connected with a specific function (including research 
undertaken by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the 
Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, the Australian  Institute of 
Marine Science, and the Australian  Research Council)  
• overall economic and statistical services  
• government superannuation benefits (excluding nominal interest expenses on unfunded 
liabilities, which are included under the nominal superannuation interest sub -function 
in the other purposes function).

a) A further breakdown of the foreign affairs and economic aid sub -function is provided in Table 5.4.1.  
b) A further breakdown of the general research sub -function is provided in Table 5.4.2.  
 
Total general public  services expenses are estimated to increase by 4.5 per cent over the 
period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29. The largest movement in expenses are for government 
superannuation benefits , foreign affairs and economic aid and financial and fiscal 
affairs .  
Legislative and executive affairs  expenses largely reflect the maintenance of parliamentary 
functions and personnel, and the expenditure profile of the Australian Electoral 
Commission (AEC). The decrease in expenses from 2024 –25 to 2026 –27 reflects the 
reduction in estimated AEC expenses following the federal election in 2024 –25. The  
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 122 | Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
decrease in expenses from 2027 –28 to 2028 –29 reflects the reduction in estimated AEC 
expenses following the federal election expected in 2027 –28. 
Financial and fiscal affairs  expenses are expected to decrease over the period 2025 –26 to 
2028 –29. These expenses include the Government ’s extension of several Australian 
Taxation Office compliance programs in the 2025 –26 Budget, to ensure multinationals, 
businesses and individuals are paying the right amount of tax in Australia.  
Foreign affairs and economic aid  expenses are expected to increase over the period 
2025 –26 to 2028 –29. This largely reflects payment cycles of Australia ’s contributions under 
funding arrangements for multilateral funds.  
Table 5.4.1 sets out the major components of the foreign affairs and economic aid  
sub-function.

terms. This differs from the international measure of aid, Official Development Assistance  reporting , 
which is in cash terms. Aid spending by other entities is usually reflected in other sub -functions.  
c) Diplomacy includes departmental expenditure for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ’s 
operations, security and IT, overseas property and international climate change engagement.  
 
General research  expenses are expected to remain broadly stable over the period 2025 –26 
to 2028 –29, with moderate fluctuations reflecting funding allocations to research and 
research infrastructure programs.

Expenses for general services  are largely incurred by the Department of Finance, the 
Australian Public Service Commission, and Comcare. General services  expenses are 
estimated to increase over the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29. This largely reflects the impact of 
insurance claims expenditure.  
Expenses for government superannuation benefits  are estimated to increase over the 
period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29. The higher estimated expenses in 2024 –25 primarily reflect the 
use of different discount rates. In accordance with accounting standards, superannuation 
expenses for 2024 –25 are calculated using the long -term government bond rate that best 
matched each individual scheme ’s duration of liabilities at the start of the financial year. 
These rates are between 4.2 and 4.8 per cent per  year. In preparing th e latest Long Term 
Cost Reports, the scheme actuaries have determined that a discount rate of 5.0  per cent 
should be applied to the 2025 –26 Budget year and forward estimates as per usual practice.  
Defence  
The defence function includes expenses incurred by the Department of Defence (Defence) 
and other agencies that support:  
• Australian military operations  
• National defence, through strategic policy advice and the delivery of capabilities to 
achieve an integrated and focused force, harnessing effects across the maritime, land, 
air, space, and cyber domains.   
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 124 | Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
The defence function does not include expenses incurred by the Department of Veterans ’ 
Affairs, superannuation payments to retired military personnel, related nominal 
superannuation interest, and housing assistance provided through Defence Housing 
Australia. These expenses are reported in the social security and welfare, general public 
services, other purposes, and housing and community amenities functions, respectively.  
Table  5.5: Summary of expenses  – defence

Total defence  49,344  51,483  52,567  56,487  61,238  
Total expenses for the defence  sub-function are estimated to increase by 18.9  per cent over 
the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29. This growth reflects the funding required to deliver the 
2024  National Defence Strategy  and 2024 Integrated Investment Program  and includes the 
Government ’s previous commitment of an additional $50.3 billion over ten years from 
2024 –25, and $7.7  billion per year ongoing, to prioritise Defence capabilities that support an 
integrated, focused force that is positioned to safeguard Australia ’s security and prosperity.  
Public order and safety  
The public order and safety function includes expenses to support the administration of the 
federal legal system and the provision of legal services, including legal aid, to the 
community. Public order and safety expenses also include law enforcement, bord er 
protection and intelligence activities, and the protection of Australian Government 
property.  
Table  5.6: Summary of expenses  – public order and safety

a)  A further breakdown of the other public order and safety sub -function is provided in Table  5.6.1.  
 
Total expenses for public order and safety are estimated to decrease by 14.5  per cent over 
the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29, largely due to a reduction in expenses for other public order 
and safety.  
Courts and legal services  expenses are expected to remain relatively stable over the period 
2025 –26 to 2028 –29, with a slight increase in expenditure in 2025 –26 for the Administrative 
Review Tribunal and migration -related legal matters in accordance with demand.  These 
expenses include the Government ’s investment in a new National Access to Justice 
Partnership in the 2024 –25 MYEFO, including a commitment to ongoing funding .  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  | Page 125 
The profile of other public order and safety  expenses is largely a result of three factors. 
First, from 2025 –26, funding is currently scheduled  to end for some National Partnership 
Payments for public order and safety. This funding will be considered for extension by the 
Government in a future economic update. Second, consistent with past practice, 
supplementary funding is provided to the Australian Border Force on an annual basis for 
border protection activities, based on operational requirements. In 2025 –26, the 
supplementary increase to border protection funding is $267.0 million, bringing total 
funding in 2025 –26 to $2.0  billion.  Third, the  Government ’s investment through the 2025 –26 
Budget measure Illicit Tobacco Compliance and Enforcement Package  – direct and targeted 
enforcement to counter profits from illicit tobacco  contributes to the expenses in 2025 –26 and 
2026 –27.

Education  
The education function includes expenses to support the delivery of education services 
through higher education institutions, vocational education and training providers 
(including technical and further education institutions), and government (state and 
territory) and non -government schools.

Page 126 | Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
Total education expenses are  estimated to increase by 11.8  per cent over the period 2025 –26 
to 2028 –29, reflecting the Government ’s ongoing investment in schools, higher education, 
and vocational education and training programs . 
Higher education  expenses are estimated to increase over the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29, 
primarily driven by growth in funding for Commonwealth supported study places at 
universities, including funding to better support students from under -represented 
backgrounds and those studying at regional campuses.   
Vocational and other education  expenses are estimated to decrease over the period 
2025 –26 to 2028 –29. This reflects the profile of Government investment in vocational 
education and training under the five -year National Skills Agreement , which commenced on 
1 January  2024, and is currently due to end on 31  December 2028.  
Non -government schools and government schools  expenses are both estimated to increase 
over the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29 due to an increase in the number of students that are 
eligible to attract a ‘student with disability ’ loading. Increases in expenses  are also due to 
growth in general non-government school student enrolments and the Commonwealth 
increasing funding for government schools through  bilateral agreements under  the new 
Better and Fairer Schools Agreement . 
Student assistance  expenses are estimated to increase over the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29, 
primarily driven by growth in student numbers. This follows a peak in expenses in 2024 –25 
resulting from the one -off 20 per cent reduction on the outstanding balance of student loan 
debts announced in the 2024 –25 MYEFO measure Building Australia ’s Future – A fairer deal 
for students.  
Health  
The health function includes expenses relating to medical services funded through 
Medicare, payments to the states and territories to deliver essential health services 
(including public hospitals), the Pharmaceutical Benefits and Repatriation Pharmaceutica l 
Benefits Schemes, the Private Health Insurance Rebate, Aboriginal and Torres  Strait 
Islander health programs, mental health services, and health workforce initiatives.

a) A further breakdown of the medical services and benefits sub -function is provided in Table  5.8.1 . 
b) A further breakdown of the pharmaceutical benefits and services sub -function is provided in Table  5.8.2.  
c) The hospital services sub -function predominantly reflects Commonwealth funding to the states and 
territories  for veterans ’ hospital services.  
 
Expenses for the health function are expected to increase by 8.0  per cent over the period 
2025 –26 to 2028 –29. The largest movement in expenses for the health function is estimated 
to occur in medical services and benefits and assistance to the states for public hospitals . 
Expenses for the remaining sub -functions are expected to remain relatively stable over the 
period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29. 
Medical services and benefits  expenses, which primarily consist of Medical Benefits and 
Private Health Insurance expenses, comprise 35. 9 per cent of total estimated health 
expenses for 2025 –26. These expenses are expected to increase over the period 2025 –26 to 
2028 –29, primarily driven by growth in the Medical Benefits program as a result of the

Pharmaceutical benefits and services  expenses , primarily the Pharmaceutical Benefits 
Scheme (PBS), comprise 18.1 per cent of total estimated health expenses for 2025 –26. The 
Government is investing more than $3.2  billion over five years from 2024 –25 through a 
range of 2025 –26 Budget measures to ensure ongoing affordable access to medicines. This 
includes new and amended listings on the PBS, reducing the general patient PBS 
co-payment to $25 and improving access to medicines through the 2025 –26 Budget measure 
Improving Access to Medicines and Pharmacy Programs.

The Government ’s contribution to public hospitals is reported through the  assistance to the 
states for public hospitals  sub-function. Hospital services covered by this sub -function 
include all admitted services, programs that deliver hospital services in the home, and 
emergency department services.  Expenses for this sub -function  are expected to increase 
over the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29, reflecting the Government ’s agreement with the states 
and territories to extend the 2020 –2025 National Health Reform Agreement Addendum for 
one year in 2025 –26, and provide additional funding in 2025 –26 to help cut elective surgery 
waiting lists, reduce waiting times in emergency departments, and manage ambulance 
ramping.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  | Page 129 
Health services  include expenses associated with the delivery of medical research, mental 
health, blood and blood products, disbursements from the Medical Research Future Fund , 
preventive health, and health protection. Expenses are expected to decrease over the period 
2025 –26 to 2028 –29, reflecting the currently scheduled end date of some  national 
partnership agreements, and preventive health and chronic disease  measures which  will be 
considered for extension  in a future economic update. The decrease in exp enses is partially 
offset by increases in estimated expenses for blood and blood products.  
Expenses for  general administration  include the Government ’s general administrative 
costs associated with health and aged care, funding for primary health care and 
coordination, investment in health workforce measures, and support for rural health 
initiatives. Expenses are expected to decrease over the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29, largely 
reflecting the completion of ICT projects to deliver essential enhancements to critical aged 
care digital systems, and time -limited funding to support implementation of aged  care 
reform.  
Expenses for Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander health  are expected to increase from 
2024 –25 to 2025 –26, reflecting the Government ’s commitment to Closing the Gap for First 
Nations peoples ’ health and wellbeing. Expenses are expected to marginally decrease over 
the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29, due to the currently scheduled end date of some  measures  
which  will be considered for extension  in a future economic update . 
Social security and welfare  
The social security and welfare function includes expenses for pensions and services to the 
aged, assistance to the unemployed and the sick, people with disabilities and families with 
children, and income support and compensation for veterans and their dep endants. It also 
includes assistance provided to Indigenous Australians that has not been included under 
other functions.

Expenses in social security and welfare are estimated to increase by 11.2  per cent over the 
period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29. The largest movements in expenses are expected to occur in 
assistance to people with disabilities , assistance to the aged  and assistance to families 
with children . The remaining sub -functions are estimated to remain broadly stable over the 
period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29. 
Assistance to the aged  expenses  are estimated to increase over the period 2025 –26 to  
2028 –29, primarily driven by increases in expenditure in the Support for Seniors and Aged 
Care Services programs.  
The Support for Seniors program is estimated to increase over the period 2025 –26 to 
2028 –29, reflecting the expected increase in the number of Age Pension recipients as the 
Australian population ages.  
The significant drivers of growth in the Aged Care Services program are the expanding 
ageing population, rising demand for aged care services, and increased funding for aged 
care workers ’ wages due to the Fair Work Commission ’s Aged Care Work Value case 
decisions . This growth in estimated expenses is also due to  the implementation of aged care 
reforms, including the new Support at Home program from 1 July 2025.  The growth in 
estimated expenses is partially offset by increases in means -tested contributions f or people 
entering residential aged care and a new participant contribution framework for the 
Support at Home program.

Assistance to veterans and dependants  expenses are estimated to decrease slightly over 
the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29, reflecting a reduction in expenses for income support and 
compensation payments to veterans due to a  forecast reduction in the volume of claims. 
This follows an increase in the volume of claims lodged in 2024 –25 and the processing of 
outstanding claims following the clearance of the claims backlog due to the Government ’s 
investments in the Department of Veterans ’ Affairs . Expenses are projec ted to peak in  
2024 –25 and remain elevated in 2025 –26, before  decreasing in  2026 –27 once the outstanding 
permanent impairment claims have been processed.  
Assistance to people with disabilities  expenses are expected to increase over the period 
2025 –26 to 2028 –29, reflecting an increase in the number of people with disability 
participating in the NDIS and increases in individual support costs, and continued growth 
in Disability Support Pension recipient numbers and average payment rates along with the 
gradual resolution of the claims backlog .

Scheme delivered through the National Disability Insurance Agency, which is a Commonwealth agency

Social Services.  
 
Assistance to families with children  expenses are expected to increase over the period 
2025 –26 to 2028 –29. This increase primarily reflects increases in the Child Care Subsidy and 
the 2024 –25 MYEFO measures Building Australia ’s Future – delivering pay rises for early 
educators  and Building Australia ’s Future – Early Childhood Education and Care Reforms . 
Assistance to families with children  expenses are expected to  increase due to higher 
Parental Leave Pay expenses, including an increase in both the number of recipients and 
the average payment rates due to recent legislative changes to the Paid Parental Leave 
Scheme. On 20  March  2024, amendments were made to the Paid Parental Leave Amendment 
(More Support for Working Families) Act 2024  to provide an additional two weeks of payment 
to Parental Leave Pay each year in July  2025 and July  2026. On 1  October  2024 , amendments 
were made to the Paid Parental Leave Amendment (Adding Superannuation for a More Secure 
Retirement) Act 2024  to include a superannuation payment on government -funded Paid 
Parental Leave Scheme payments for births and adoptions on or after 1  July 2025 .

Expenses for assistance to the unemployed and the sick  are estimated to increase slightly 
over the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29, primarily driven by growth in the expected number of 
JobSeeker Payment recipients, as the current close -to-historic low unemployment rate is 
expected to modestly increase.   
Expenses for assistance for Indigenous Australians nec  (not elsewhere classified)  includes 
investments in a range of measures to deliver outcomes across portfolios addressing the 
Priority Reforms and Socioeconomic Targets under the National Agreement on Closing the 
Gap. Major investments through the 2025 –26 Budget measures Northern Territory Remote 
Aboriginal Investment – future arrangements and Closing the Gap  – further investments  and the 
2024 –25 Budget measure Remote Jobs and Economic Development Program  deliver on the 
Government ’s commitment to improve outcomes for First Nations peop le in remote 
Australia.  
Housing and community amenities  
The housing and community amenities function includes expenses for the Government ’s 
contribution to the National Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness , other Australian 
Government housing programs, the expenses of Defence  Housing Australia (DHA), urban 
and regional development programs and environmental protection initiatives.

Page 134 | Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
Expenses for housing and community amenities are expected to decrease by 42.7  per cent 
over the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29, primarily driven by a decrease in expenses for urban 
and regional development and environment protection . 
Housing  expenses include the provision of housing for the general public and people with 
special needs, DHA expenses and the Government ’s contribution of $9.3 billion over five 
years from 2024 –25 for the National Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness , which 
supports states and territories to provide social housing and homelessness services. 
Expenses  are estimated to decrease from 2025 –26 to 2028 –29, primarily driven by expected 
timing of grant payments under the National Housing Infrastructure Facili ty and a change 
in accounting treatment of grant funding under the Housing Australia Future Fund Facility 
(HAFFF) and National Housing Accord Facility (NHAF).  
The Government has committed to a significant investment in housing through Rounds 1 
and 2 of the HAFFF and NHAF. In accordance with accounting standards, Housing 
Australia reflects its liability for all future availability payments under the HAFFF and 
NHAF as expenditure at  the point it enters into contracts. This will occur in 2024 –25 for 
Rounds 1 and 2, resulting in $6.4 billion being recognised in 2024 –25 and no longer being 
reflected in future years (payments will continue to be made over the 25 -year p eriod). 
Remaining Housing Australia Future Fund disbursements are allocated across the forward 
estimates as funding for future housing funding rounds will be recognised in the same 
way, once the parameters for each funding round are established .  
Expenses for  urban and regional development  comprise urban development, services to 
territories, and regional development programs. Expenses are estimated to decrease over 
the period 20 24–25 to 2028 –29, primarily reflecting the profile of funding for the Priority 
Community Infrastructure Program, the Investing in Our Communities Program, the 
Growing Regions Program, and the conclusion  of the final grants under the Community 
Development Grants Programme.  
Environment protection  expenses comprise  a variety of initiatives, including the protection 
and conservation of the environment, water and waste management, pollution abatement 
and environmental research. Expenses are estimated to decrease over the period 2025 –26 to 
2028 –29, primarily due to the deferral of construction for the Paradise  Dam and Big Rocks 
Weir projects and the Hughenden Irrigation Scheme  until beyond 2028 –29, and the  planned 
termination of the Critical Inputs to Clean Energy Industries progr am from 2026 –27. 
Recreation and culture  
The recreation and culture function includes expenses to support public broadcasting and 
cultural institutions, funding for the arts and the film industry, assistance to sport and 
recreation activities, as well as the management and protection of national parks and other 
world heritage areas. This function also includes expens es relating to the protection and 
preservation of historic sites and buildings, including war graves.

Total expenses under the recreation and culture function are estimated to increase by 
8.7 per cent over the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29. This is primarily driven by expenses in 
sport and recreation , which are linked to the Government ’s investment in venue 
infrastructure for the 2032 Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic Games.  
Broadcasting  expenses reflect the five -year funding terms for the Australian Broadcasting 
Corporation and Special Broadcasting Services Corporation that commenced on 
1 July 2023.

The major program within this function is the fuel tax credits s cheme , for which payments 
are expected to increase over the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29. This largely reflects an 
expected increase in the use of fuels that are eligible for the Fuel Tax Credit s Scheme.  
Resources and energy  expenses are expected to fluctuate over the period 2024 –25 to  
2028 –29. The 2025 –26 Budget measure Energy  Bill Relief Fund  Extension  is expected to 
increase  expenses in 2025 –26, reflecting the Government ’s focus on providing immediate 
cost-of-living relief.  
Expenses for the renewable energy  component are expected to increase in 2025 –26, before 
decreasing in  2026 –27 and returning to a stable trend, reflecting the profile of expenses for 
the concessional component of the concessional loan deployment by the Clean Energy Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  | Page 137 
Finance Corporation. The forecasted loan deployment is primarily expected to be made 
under the Rewiring the Nation Program , established in the  2022 –23 October Budget and 
recapitalised in the 2024 –25 MYEFO .  
Agriculture, forestry and fishing  
The agriculture, forestry and fishing function includes expenses to support assistance to 
primary producers, forestry, fishing, land and water resources management,  biosecurity 
services, and contributions to research and development.

Total expenses for agriculture, forestry and fishing are estimated to decrease by 
28.7 per cent over the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29. The expected decrease largely reflects the 
reduction in natural resources development  primarily due to the schedule of water reform 
activities to deliver the Murray –Darling Basin Plan 2012  by the 31 December 2027 deadline 
set out in the Water Amendment (Restoring Our Rivers) Act 2023 . 
Mining, manufacturing and construction  
The mining, manufacturing and construction function includes expenses for programs 
designed to promote the efficiency and competitiveness of Australian industries. The major 
components include the Research and Development Tax Incentive and industry 
assistance  programs.

Expenses for the research and development tax incentive  administered by the Australian 
Taxation Office are expected to increase over the period 202 5–26 to 202 8–29 due to increases 
in the number and value of expected claims from eligible companies.  
Expenses under the growing business investment  component are expected to decrease 
over the period 202 5–26 to 202 8–29, due to the currently scheduled end date of some  
measures  which  will be considered for extension  in a future economic update.  
The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility  offers debt and equity finance to projects 
that contribute to the establishment or enhancement of economic activity in northern 
Australia. Expenses are expected to remain stable over the period 202 5–26 to 202 8–29, 
reflecting concessional loan discount expenses associated with the expected commitment of 
concessional loans . 
Expenses under the other  component are expected to increase over the period 202 5–26 to 
2028–29, largely driven by the  Critical Minerals Production Tax Incentive, commencing 
from 2027 –28.  Budget Paper No. 1  |

Transport and communication  
The transport and communication function includes expenses to support the infrastructure 
and regulatory framework for Australia ’s transport and communication sectors. Expenses 
for the transport and communication function primarily reflect the Government ’s 
investment in road and rail transport through the Infrastructure Investment Program. This 
function also includes expenditure for communications activities and support for the digital 
economy through the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional D evelopment, 
Communications and the Arts, and the Australian Communications and Media Authority.

Total expenses under this function are estimated to remain relatively stable from 2025 –26 to 
2028 –29, with movements in the function largely reflecting the timing of priority 
infrastructure projects under the Infrastructure Investment Program.  
Communication  expenses are estimated to decrease over the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29, 
primarily reflecting the funding profile for the Better Connectivity Plan for Regional and 
Rural Australia.  
Rail transport  expenses are estimated to decrease from 2024 –25 to 2025 –26 and fluctuate 
over the period 2025 –26 and 2028–29, reflecting the delivery schedules  of major rail 
infrastructure projects, including projects under the METRONET program and 
Melbourne  Airport Rail Link.  
Air transport  expenses primarily relate to activities of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority 
and aviation related initiatives. Total expenses are estimated to decrease  over the period 
2025 –26 to 2028 –29 due to the completion of preparatory work for the Western Sydney 
International (Nancy -Bird Walton) Airport, finalisation of investigations for per - and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at airports, and the timing of expenditure associated 
with regional aviation programs.    
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 140 | Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
Road transport  expenses are estimated to increase from 2024 –25 to 202 5–26 and remain 
relatively stable over the period  2025 –26 to 2028 –29. The expenditure profile reflects 
continued investment in priority road infrastructure projects and realignment of funding to 
more accurately reflect project delivery schedules. Through the 2025 –26 Budget measure 
Building a Better Future Through Considered Infrastructure Investment , the Government is 
providing $ 17.1 billion over 10 years from 2024 –25 towards priority road  and rail projects.  
Total expenses for other transport and communication are estimated to decrease over the 
period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29, primarily reflecting the timeline of departmental activities to 
support the delivery of priority infrastructure and transport initiatives and the expected 
conclusion of the Regional Roads Austra lia Mobile Program.  
Other economic affairs  
The other economic affairs function includes expenses on tourism and area promotion, 
labour market assistance, immigration, industrial relations, and other economic affairs not 
elsewhere classified (nec).

Total  expenses for other  economic affairs are estimated to decrease by 9.4  per cent over the 
period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29 largely reflecting forecast reductions in expenses for 
immigration  and vocational and industry training . 
  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  | Page 141 
Vocational and industry training  expenses are estimated to decrease over the period 
2025 –26 to 2028 –29, primarily reflecting the continuing transition in apprenticeship 
incentives from their peak during the COVID -19 pandemic. This includes the cessation of 
the temporary Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements wage subsidy, which is closed to 
new applicants, and the scheduled step -down in ongoing priority apprenticeship incentives 
from 1 January 2026. The decrease is partially offset by additional support the Government 
is providing to apprentices and their employers through the 2025 –26 Budget measure 
Building Australia ’s Future – Increased Support for Apprenti ces, which includes targeted 
incentives to boost apprenticeship commencements in critical construction occupations to 
be introduced from 1 July 2025.  
Labour market assistance to job seekers and industry  expenses are estimated to increase 
over the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29, reflecting the Government ’s commitment to strengthen 
Australia ’s employment services system and improve outcomes for individuals accessing 
employment services more broadly.  
Industrial relations  expenses are estimated to slightly decrease over the period 2025 –26 to 
2028 –29, largely due to the cessation of  components in the 2024 –25 Budget measure  
Workplace Relations . This decrease is expected to be partially offset by a range of supports to 
progress the Government ’s workplace relations agenda, critical to the implementation of 
changes made by the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Act 2023 , and 
further reforms passed in the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes No.2) Act 
2024.  
The immigration  sub-function includes the provision of migration and citizenship services, 
the management of unlawful non -citizens, regional cooperation, and refugee and 
humanitarian assistance. Immigration  expenses are expected to decrease over the period 
2025 –26 to 2028 –29, primarily reflecting forecast reductions in the transitory population in 
the offshore processing centre, and persons accessing migrant and humanitarian services.  
Table  5.16.1 sets out the major components of the immigration  sub-function.

Expenses for other economic affairs nec are expected to decrease over the period 2025 –26 
to 2028 –29, reflecting a decrease in departmental expenses for the Department of Industry, 
Science, and Resources and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).   
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 142 | Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
The departmental expense projections for the Department of Industry, Science and 
Resources over the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29 reflect  the 2025 –26 Budget measure  Investing 
in the Future of Science . This includes  time -limited funding to the National Measurement 
Institute in 2025 –26 to address critical remediation works and sustain reliable Australian 
measurement capability to underpin the Government ’s Future Made in Australia  agenda.  
The decrease in departmental expenses for ASIC over the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29 is 
mainly driven by the funding profile of the stabilisation and uplift of business registers 
component of the 2025 –26 Budget measure Treasury Portfolio – additional resourcing . This 
will provide funding to deliver the second tranche of stabilisation and uplift of ASIC ’s 
business registers, with expenses reducing due to completion of the current phase of work 
and termination of other measures over the period.

Other purposes  
The other purposes  function includes expenses incurred in the servicing of public debt 
interest, and assistance to state, territory and local governments. This function also includes 
items classified as natural disaster relief, the contingency reserve, and expenses related to 
the nominal interest on unfunded liabilities for government superannuation  benefits.

Total other purposes  135,322  149,706  166,306  181,992  200,374  
Total expenses for other purposes are estimated to increase by 33.8 per cent over the period 
2025 –26 to 2028 –29. 
The main drivers of the increase in other purposes  expenses are general purpose 
inter -government transactions , public debt interest  and the contingency reserve . 
Public debt interest  expenses are expected to increase  over the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29, 
largely reflecting higher debt servicing costs.  
The increase in nominal superannuation interest  expenses from 2024 –25 to 2025 –26 
primarily reflects the use of updated discount rates. In accordance with accounting 
standards, superannuation expenses for 2024 –25 are calculated using the long -term 
government bond rate that best matched each individual scheme ’s duration of liabilities at 
the start of the financial year. These rates were between 4.2 and 4.8 per cent per year. In 
preparing the latest Long Term Cost Reports, the scheme actuaries have determined that a 
discount rate of 5.0  per cent should be applied to the estimates in the budget year and 
forward estimates as per usual practice.  
General purpose inter -government transactions  expenses are made up of general revenue 
assistance paid to state and territory governments and local government assistance and are 
expected to increase over the period 2025 –26 to 2028 –29. Nearly all these  expenses relate to 
general revenue assistance, largely comprised of payments of GST entitlements provided to 
state and territory governments on an ‘untied ’ basis. Payments to state and territory 
governments tied to specific purposes are reported under the relev ant functions in this 
Statement. Further information on general revenue assistance to the states and territories 
can be found in Budget Paper No. 3 , Federal Financial Relations.  
   
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 144 | Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
Expenses for  natural disaster relief  reflect financial support provided by the Australian 
Government to states and territories under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery 
Arrangements and, since November 2018, the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements. 
Expenses also reflect departmental funding for the National Emergency Management 
Agency. The majority of funding over the period 2025 –26 to 2027 –28 reflects expected 
payments to the states in relation to disaster events that have already occurred. As 
provisions are not generally made for fu ture disasters, the amount reduces over time. 
Additional funding is provisioned as needed in response to natural disasters. In the 
2025 –26 Budget, a provision of $1.2 billion has been included in the contingency reserve  
sub-function to meet the disaster recovery costs associated with recent natural disasters, 
including ex -Tropical Cyclone Alfred.  
The contingency reserve  is estimated to increase expenses by $ 40.8 billion over the period 
2025 –26 to 2028 –29. Nearly two thirds  of this is the conservative bias allowance, which 
makes provision for the tendency for the estimate of expenses for existing government 
policy (excluding GST payments to the states) to be revised upwards in the forward years. 
The 2025 –26 Budget includes a  provision of:  
• nil in the Budget year 2025 –26 
• half of a percentage point of total general government sector expenses in the first 
forward year 2026 –27 ($3.5 billion)  
• 1 per cent of general government sector expenses in the second forward year 2027 –28 
($7.3 billion)  
• 2 per cent of general government sector expenses in the third forward year 2028 –29 
($15.3 billion).  
The drawdown of the conservative bias allowance decreased expenses by $1.7 billion in 
2025 –26, $1.7 billion in 2026 –27, $3.6 billion in 2027 –28 and $2.9 billion in 2028 –29. This is 
consistent with long standing practice and does not represent a saving or o ffset to spending 
measures.  
The contingency reserve also includes a provision to reflect expected increased 
contributions to the states and territories for the future National Health Reform Agreement 
Addendum, Disability Foundational Supports and the Better and Fairer Schools 
Agreement.  
In general, the contingency reserve can include:  
• commercial -in-confidence and national security -in-confidence items that cannot be 
disclosed separately  
• financial assistance to state and territory governments for future programs and reforms 
subject to negotiations, including commitments made by National Cabinet  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  | Page 145 
• the effect on the budget and forward estimates of economic parameter revisions 
received late in the process , and hence not able to be allocated to individual entities or 
functions  
• decisions taken but not yet announced by the Government, and decisions made too late 
for inclusion against individual entity estimates  
• provisions for other specific events and policy changes that may impact the budget 
estimates , including the continuation of terminating measures  
• a provision for underspends in the current financial year reflecting the tendency for 
budgeted expenses for some entities or functions not to be met.

Page 146 | Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
General government net capital investment  
Net capital investment is broadly defined as the sale and acquisition of non -financial assets, 
less depreciation expenses. It provides a measure of the overall growth in capital assets 
(including buildings and infrastructure, specialist military equipment, and computer 
software) after taking into account depreciation and amortisati on as previously acquired 
assets age.  
Government capital spending involves the acquisition of physical assets and financial 
assets, and the provision of grants and subsidies to others (primarily state and territory 
governments), which they then use to acquire assets.  
Australian Government general government sector net capital investment is expected to 
grow from $8.8 billion in 2025 –26 to $10.2 billion in 2028 –29. This growth, along with the  
significant increase from 2024 –25 to 2025 –26, primarily reflects  capability investments 
prioritised in the 2024  National Defence Strategy and 2024 Integrated Investment Program . 
Details of movements are further explained in the following section.

Estimated net capital investment for 2025 –26 is $0.7 billion  higher when compared to the 
estimate for 2025 –26 in the 2024 –25 Budget. This  is driven by an increase of $0.6  billion 
from policy decisions and an increase of $0.1 billion  due to parameter and other variations.

A significant component of the Government ’s net capital investment occurs in the defence 
function and primarily relates to Defence capability investments. Major factors contributing 
to changes in net capital investment are expected to occur in the following functions:  
• Defence  – the increase in net capital investment from 2025 –26 to 2028 –29 reflects 
funding for capability investments prioritised in the 2024 National Defence Strategy and 
2024 Integrated Investment Program . 
• General public services  – the increase in net capital investment from 2025 –26 to  
2027 –28 followed by the decrease in 2028 –29 largely reflects the timing of estimated 
renewal of property leases that are due to expire and the timing of building and 
equipment purchases and refurbishment.  
• Social security and welfare  – the decrease in net capital investment over the period 
2025 –26 to 2028 –29 is largely driven by the depreciation and amortisation of prior 
Commonwealth investments into Services Australia ’s assets, including ICT capabilities 
and infrastructure.  
• Housing and community amenities  – the increase in net capital investment from 
2024 –25 to 2026 –27 and decrease in 2027 –28 and 2028 –29 largely reflects Defence 
Housing Australia ’s property investment strategy to meet the housing needs of 
Australian Defence Force personnel.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  | Page 149 
• Recreation and culture  – the decrease in net capital investment over the period 2025 –26 
to 202 8–29 primarily reflects the expected completion of capital investments at the 
Australian War Memorial, the anticipated timing of projects under the 2024 –25 Budget 
measure Australian Institute of Sport Site Redevelopment , various  projects being delivered 
by the Director of National Parks  and capital projects at the National Collecting 
Institutions.  
• Transport and communication  – the variable profile of net capital investment reflects 
the sale of non -financial assets through the 850/900 MHz spectrum auctions.  
• Other economic affairs  – the profile of net capital investment over the period 2025 –26 
to 2028 –29 primarily reflects forecast renewal of the Department of Home Affairs ’ 
property leases .

account depreciation or amortisation.

Debt Statement  
Gross debt and net debt are expected to be significantly lower than estimated at the 
2022  Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook (PEFO) in every year of the forward 
estimates.  
By the end of 2024 –25, gross debt is expected to be 11.1  percentage points of GDP 
($177  billion) lower than estimated at PEFO. Gross debt is estimated to be 35.5  per cent of 
GDP at the end of 2025 –26, 9.2  percentage points lower than estimated at the PEFO and 
0.5 percentage  points lower than estimated at the 202 4–25 MYEFO. Gross debt is expected 
to peak at 37.0  per cent of GDP in 2029 –30, 7.9  percentage points lower than the peak at the 
PEFO, before falling to 31.9  per cent in 2035 –36. 
Net debt in 2024 –25 is expected to be 13.1  percentage points of GDP ($267  billion) lower 
than estimated at the PEFO.  
Interest payments  on Australian Government Securities are estimated to be $26.3  billion in 
2025–26, increasing to $36.6  billion by 2028 –29. Over the 5-years to 2028 –29, total interest 
payments on AGS are expected to be $3.3  billion lower than estimated at MYEFO.

Statement 6: Debt Statement  | Page 157  Statement 6: Debt Statement  
The Debt Statement provides information on Government gross debt, net debt, 
Australian  Government Securities (AGS) issuance and interest costs.  
Australian Government Securities issuance  
The Australian  Government finances its activities either through receipts or borrowing. 
When receipts fall short of payments, the Government borrows by issuing AGS.  
The Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) is responsible for issuing AGS 
and managing the Government ’s financing activities. The AOFM exercises operational 
independence in the execution of its duties. Further details on the AOFM ’s operations can 
be found on the AOFM website at www.aofm.gov.au .  
Estimates of AGS on issue  
Estimates of AGS on issue are published in both face value and market value terms in 
this Statement.  
• The face value  of AGS on issue (also referred to as gross debt) is the amount the 
Government pays back to investors at maturity, independent of fluctuations in market 
prices.1 The total face value of AGS on issue changes when new securities are issued, or 
when securities are repurchased or reach maturity.  
• The market value  of AGS on issue represents the value of securities as traded on the 
secondary market, which changes continuously with movements in market prices (often 
quoted as a yield to maturity). Consistent with external reporting standards, the market 
value of AGS o n issue is reported in the Australian  Government general government 
sector balance sheet.  
The Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911  (CIS Act) requires the Treasurer to issue a 
direction stipulating the maximum face value of relevant AGS that may be on issue. 
Effective from 7  October  2020, the then Treasurer directed that the maximum face value of 
AGS that can be on issue is $1,200  billion.  
  
— 
1  For Treasury Indexed Bonds (TIBs), the final repayment amount paid to investors includes 
an additional amount to reflect the impact of inflation over the life of the security. 
This  additional amount is not included in the calculation of face value.

Page 158 | Statement 6: Debt Statement  
Gross debt is estimated to be $1,022  billion (35.5  per cent of GDP) in 2025 –26, increasing to 
$1,223  billion (36.8  per cent of GDP) in 2028 -29. Gross debt relative to GDP is expected to be 
lower than at the 2024 –25 MYEFO from 2024 –25 to 2026 –27 and higher than MYEFO in 
2027–28 and 2028 –29.  
The decline in gross debt relative to GDP in the first 3-years of the forward estimates since 
MYEFO reflects improvements in the headline cash balance and upward revisions to 
nominal GDP. The increase in gross debt relative to GDP in 2027 –28 and 2028 -29 since 
MYEFO is primarily driven by downward revisions to nominal GDP in these years.

Changes in AGS on issue since the 2024 –25 MYEFO  
The total face value of AGS on issue is expected to remain broadly unchanged at the end of 
the 4-years to 2027 –28 compared to the 2024 –25 MYEFO. The decrease in face value of AGS 
on issue in 2025 –26 and 2026 –27 compared to MYEFO primarily reflects cumulative 
improvements in the headline cash balance.

Treasury Bonds  
As at 11  March  2025, there were 30 Treasury Bond lines on issue, with a weighted average 
term to maturity of 6.4  years and the longest maturity extending to June  2054.  
One Treasury Bond line is the Green Treasury Bond maturing in June  2034. The 
Government issued its first Green Treasury Bond in June  2024. Green Treasury Bonds 
provide financing or refinancing for specific government programs that drive Australia ’s 
net zero transformation and support Australia ’s environmental goals. The inaugural Green 
Treasury Bond Allocation and Impact Report  was published in February  2025. The report 
outlines the allocation of Green Treasury Bond proceeds issued in 2023 –24 to eligible 
government programs in 2022 –23 and 2023 –24 and the associated climate and 
environmental impacts.

Non-resident holdings of AGS on issue  
In the December  2024 quarter, the proportion of non -resident holdings of AGS was 
51 per cent (Chart  6.1). This proportion is down from historical highs of 77  per cent in 2012. 
While the value of non -resident holdings of AGS has increased significantly over this time, 
the proportion has fallen since the rate of buying by non -resident investors has not 
matched the rate of issuance. In addition, the Reserve Bank of Australia ’s bond purchase 
operations in 2020 and 2021 reduced the amount of AGS available to oth er investors, 
including non -residents.

Net debt  
Net debt is equal to the sum of interest -bearing liabilities (which include AGS on issue 
measured at market value) less the sum of selected financial assets (cash and deposits, 
advances paid and investments, loans and placements). As net debt incorporates both 
selected financial assets and liabilities at their fair value, it provides a broader measure of  
the Government ’s financial obligations than gross debt.  
Not all government assets or liabilities are included in the measurement of net debt. 
For example, the Government ’s unfunded superannuation liability is not accounted for in 
net debt, nor are holdings of equities, for example, those held by the Future Fund or the 
Government ’s equity investment in the NBN.

Changes in net debt since the 2024 –25 MYEFO  
Net debt is expected to be higher in each year of the forward estimates compared to the 
2024–25 MYEFO. This reflects a change in Future Fund investments, loans and placements 
and the impact of lower yields on AGS.

Interest on AGS  
Estimates of the interest payments and expense of AGS on issue include the cost of AGS 
already on issue and future AGS issuance.  
• The cost of AGS already on issue reflects the actual yield at the time of issuance.  
• The expected cost of future AGS issuance is based on a recent average of daily spot rates 
across the yield curve at the time of a budget estimates update.  
Interest payments on AGS are estimated to be lower across each year of the forward 
estimates compared to the 2024 –25 MYEFO.  
Chart 6.2 shows the yield curve assumptions underpinning the 2022  PEFO,  
2024–25 MYEFO and the 2025 –26 Budget. Yields are generally lower now compared to 
MYEFO and remain significantly higher than at the PEFO. Since MYEFO, yields have 
remained volatile, reflecting heightened global economic uncertainty.  
The assumed weighted average cost of borrowing in this update has decreased to 
4.3 per cent for future issuance of Treasury Bonds over the forward estimates, broadly 
reflecting global trends in movements of yields. This is lower than the assumed weighted 
average yield of 4.4  per cent at the 2024 –25 MYEFO and higher than the weighted average 
yield of 2.2  per cent at the 2022  PEFO.

By the end of the forward estimates total interest payments are estimated to be $38.2  billion, 
of which $36.6  billion relates to AGS on issue (Table 6.9). Compared to the 2024 –25 MYEFO, 
total interest payments as a share of GDP are estimated to remain broadly unchanged 
across the forward estimates.  
Interest receipts as a share of GDP are estimated to remain broadly unchanged across each 
year of the forward estimates compared to the 2024 –25 MYEFO.  
Net interest payments as a share of GDP are estimated to remain unchanged in 2025 –26 at 
0.6 per cent, and across all years of the forward estimates, compared to the  
2024–25 MYEFO.

As well as cash accounting terms, interest costs related to AGS are also presented on 
accrual accounting terms. The difference between the cash interest payments and accrual 
interest expense generally relates to the timing of when the interest cost is reco gnised.  
• Interest payments are recognised in the period when they are paid during the life of the

Forecasting Performance   
and Sensitivity Analysis  
Economic and fiscal forecasts and projections in the Budget are underpinned by a range of 
assumptions and judgements based on the best available information at the time of 
preparation. In practice, economic and fiscal circumstances can evolve in ways that differ 
from expectations.  
This statement assesses:  
1. The performance of past forecasts based on the variance between forecasts and actuals.  
2. The uncertainty around current forecasts using confidence interval analysis.  
3. The sensitivity of current forecasts to changes in key assumptions:  
– Iron ore prices  
– Yields on Australian Government Securities.   
The fiscal impact of key developments and Australia ’s climate change outlook are 
considered in Budget Statement  3: Fiscal  Strategy  and Outlook.  
Forecasts are based on assumptions and judgements. Forecast accuracy depends on 
whether assumptions and judgements prove to be correct, and the reliability of the 
modelled economic and fiscal relationships.

Assessing past forecasting performance  
This section assesses the variance between historical forecasts and outcomes (forecast 
errors) for real and nominal GDP, tax receipts, non -tax receipts, payments and the 
underlying cash balance.  
Forecasts are prepared using a range of techniques:  
• Macroeconomic forecasts are prepared consistent with a national accounting framework 
using econometric models, analysis and professional judgement.  
• Tax receipts forecasts are generally prepared using a ‘base plus growth ’ methodology. 
The last outcome for each head of revenue is the base to which growth rates are applied, 
using appropriate economic parameters. Forecasts are then updated to include costings 
of new policy.  
• Payments forecasts are generally prepared through analysis of payment program data, 
costings for new policies and historical trends in programs, in consultation with 
relevant agencies.

Economic forecasting performance  
Real GDP forecasts incorporate technical assumptions for exchange rates, interest rates and 
commodity prices. The forecasts are informed by a macroeconomic model and incorporate 
long -term trend assumptions, and judgements about how domestic and international 
developments might affect Australia ’s economy.  
Real GDP grew by 1.4  per cent in  2023–24, which is broadly consistent with the 1½ per cent 
growth forecast at the  2023–24 Budget (Chart  7.1).

Price movements underpinning nominal GDP forecasts create greater uncertainty 
compared with real GDP forecasts. Price uncertainty relates to domestic prices and wages, 
exchange rates, prices of imported goods, and world prices for Australia ’s exports 
including commodities. Since the early  2000s, nominal GDP forecast errors have largely 
reflected volatility in global commodity prices. Recent years have experienced 
higher -than -usual volatility in commodity export prices, which generally remained above 
assumed  conservative anchor prices and glide paths for an extended period, partly due to 
the ongoing tensions in the Middle East and Ukraine.  
Nominal GDP grew by 4.1  per cent in  2023–24 rather than the 1¼  per cent growth forecast 
at the 2023 –24 Budget (Chart  7.2). This underestimation of nominal GDP growth largely 
reflected higher -than -expected commodity prices.

Fiscal forecasting performance  
Fiscal forecast errors are driven by economic and demographic forecast errors, along with 
unanticipated changes in demand for government programs. Government policies 
announced after the Budget can also affect fiscal forecast errors. Further information on  
Budget outcomes can be found in the 2023–24 Final  Budget  Outcome.  
Total receipts  
Total receipts are comprised of tax and non -tax receipts (for example, dividends from 
investment funds). Tax receipts account for over 90 per cent of total receipts and are 
therefore the main driver of forecasting performance.  
Total receipts grew 6.0 per cent in  2023–24 rather than the 5.1 per cent increase forecast at 
the 2023–24 Budget. Total receipts were $20.4  billion higher than forecast.  
Tax receipts  
Tax receipts grew 5.3 per cent in  2023–24 rather than the 4.8 per cent increase forecast at the 
2023–24 Budget (Chart  7.3). Tax receipts were $ 17.1 billion higher than forecast.  This 
outcome reflected  higher -than -expected company tax receipts and gross income tax 
withholding receipts  partially offset by weaker -than -expected excise and customs duty 
receipts and superannuation fund taxes .

On average, nominal GDP forecast errors magnify tax receipts forecast errors, owing to 
Australia ’s progressive personal income tax system (Chart  7.4).

Non-tax receipts  
Forecast variances in non -tax receipts are generally driven by financial market volatility 
which impacts investment earnings and resource royalties.  
Non -tax receipts grew by 14.5  per cent in 2023 –24 rather than the 9.1  per cent forecast at the 
2023–24 Budget (Chart 7.5). Non -tax receipts were $3.3  billion higher in 2023 –24 than 
forecast in the 2023 –24 Budget. This increase largely reflects variations in returns on 
investments, including higher -than -estimated earnings from interest on cash deposits due 
to the rise in short -term interest rates, and higher -than -estimated earnings from the Future 
Fund and other Australian Government Investment Funds. The sa le of non -financial assets 
through the 3.4/3.7 GHz Spectrum Auctions also contributed to the increases in non -tax 
receipts .

Payments  
Payments forecasting performance is affected by growth in indexation factors (for example, 
CPI growth) and demand for government programs. Demand -driven programs, such as 
payments to individuals for social welfare, form the bulk of Australian Government 
expenditure and vary with economic conditions.  
Payments increased by 7.2  per cent in 2023 –24 rather than the 8.0  per cent forecast at the 
2023–24 Budget (Chart 7.6). Payments were $9.3  billion lower in  2023–24 than forecast in 
the 2023–24 Budget. This decrease largely reflects delays in milestone payments under 
National Partnership Payment programs. Decreases to payments also resulted from a 
decline in the expected number of recipients and average paymen t rates across a number of 
programs including Student Payments and Family Tax Benefits, reflecting st rong labour  
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 176 | Statement 7: Forecasting Performance and Sensitivity Analysis  
market performance. In addition, lower than projected demand for medical services 
contributed to a decrease in payments under the Medical Benefits program.

Underlying cash balance  
Underlying cash balance  forecasting performance is driven by the forecast errors of total 
receipts and payments.  
The underlying cash surplus was 0. 6 per cent of GDP in  2023–24 rather than the forecast 
deficit of 0.5 per cent of GDP (Chart  7.7). The underlying cash balance was $ 29.7 billion 
higher than forecast. The better -than expected underlying cash balance outcome in 202 3–24 
largely reflected higher -than -expected receipts  ($20.4 billion ) and lower -than -expected 
payments ($9.3  billion) . Budget Paper No. 1  |

In the past two  decades, outside major downturns, t he underlying cash balance forecast 
error largely reflect ed forecast errors of total receipts (Chart  7.8).  
Large forecast errors for payments in  2008–09 and  2019–20 reflected unexpected 
Government payment assistance during the Global Financial Crisis and COVID –19. 
Overestimates of receipts tend to coincide with underestimates of payments during 
economic shocks,  magnifying underlying cash balance forecast errors.

Assessing forecast uncertainty – confidence interval analysis  
Confidence intervals illustrate the uncertainty around current forecasts based on the 
historical distribution of forecast errors. Confidence interval analysis assumes that future 
forecast errors are consistent with the distribution of past forecast errors .2 Based on past 
forecasting performance, there is a  70 and 90  per cent probability that the actual outcome 
will lie within the  70 and  90 per cent confidence interval bands.  
Future forecast errors may not have the same distribution as historical forecast errors. The 
large forecast errors in 2019–20 and 2020–21, related to the COVID–19 pandemic,  are an 
example of events not previously captured in the historical error sample. Large disruptive 
events are difficult to predict and could occur again in the future.

Average annualised growth in real GDP in the three  years to  2026–27 is expected to be

The confidence intervals around the nominal GDP forecasts are wider than those around 
the real GDP forecasts, reflecting the additional uncertainty around domestic prices and 
commodity prices. Average annualised growth in nominal GDP in the three  years to   
2026–27 is expected to be around 3¾ per cent, with the 70  per cent confidence interval 
ranging from 1½ per cent to 6 per cent. The 90  per cent confidence interval ranges from

Fiscal uncertainty based on historical forecast errors  
Fiscal estimates are based on economic and demographic forecasts as well as estimates of 
spending and revenue measures.  
Historical variations caused by subsequent policy decisions not known at the time of 
forecast are excluded because these decisions do not reflect forecasting errors based on 
available information at the time of preparation. Payment estimates do not exclude  the 
public debt interest associated with these subsequent policy decisions because this cannot 
be separately identified.  
Total receipts  
Total receipts (including GST) are expected to be around  25.5 per cent of GDP in  2025–26, 
with the 70  per cent confidence interval ranging from  24.0 per cent to 27.1 per cent of GDP. 
The 90  per cent confidence interval ranges from 23.1 per cent to 28.0 per cent in 202 5–26.

Page 184 | Statement 7: Forecasting Performance and Sensitivity Analysis  
Assessing current forecasts through sensitivity analysis  
Sensitivity analysis allows for an assessment of the impact of key assumptions. The 
following sensitivity analyses are considered due to their variability and importance for 
the Budget:  
• Higher and lower iron ore prices.  
• Higher and lower yields over the medium term.  
For illustrative purposes, the upper and lower sensitivities are broadly symmetric, even 
where not equally probable.   
Movements in iron ore prices  
The forecasts for nominal GDP and tax receipts are sensitive to commodity price 
assumptions, particularly iron ore prices. Iron ore is Australia ’s largest export by value, 
representing 21 per cent of the total value of goods and services  exports in  2023–24. See 
Budget  Statement  2: Economic  Outlook  for more information on the commodity price 
assumptions incorporated into the economic outlook .  
Iron ore prices are volatile and sensitive to global market developments. Table  7.1 considers 
the impact of a permanent US$10  per tonne increase and decrease in the iron ore spot price 
on nominal GDP and tax receipts relative to the Budget baseline forecast.

The effects of a US$10  per tonne increase and decrease in the iron ore price are broadly 
symmetric. The following discussion focuses mainly on an increase for illustrative 
purposes. A US$10  per tonne increase in the iron ore price increases nominal GDP by 
around $ 5.2 billion in 202 5–26, rising to around $ 10.4 billion in 202 8–29. 
The economic response to a permanent change in the price of iron ore is derived from a 
generic terms of trade shock using a forward -looking macroeconomic model. Higher iron 
ore export prices lead to a higher terms of trade, which leads directly to higher output 
prices and nominal GDP. The volume of output and exports in the mining sector increase in 
response to higher iron ore prices. However, an appreciation in the exchange rate leads to a 
substitution to imports which partially offsets the increase in exports and GDP . This change 
in the exchange rate also  acts to reduce domes tic inflation through lower import prices.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 7: Forecasting Performance and Sensitivity Analysis  | Page 185 
A US$10  per tonne increase in the assumed price for iron ore exports is expected to result 
in an increase in tax receipts of around $0.4 billion in 2025–26 and $0.5  billion  in both 
2026–27 and 2027 -28, before increasing to $ 2.1 billion in 202 8–29. An increase in iron ore 
prices increases mining company profits and therefore company tax receipts. This builds 
over time as tax receipts incorporate the  full impact of the iron ore price increase on 
nominal GDP and due to the  lag between when profits are realised and tax is paid by 
companies . The l ower domestic prices result in lower individuals and other withholding 
taxes and indirect tax receipts, partially offsetting the increase in company tax  receipts .

Movements in yields  
Government borrowing costs are sensitive to yields on Australian Government Securities 
and the level of debt. See Budget  Statement  6: Debt Statement  for further information on 
yields. Given the uncertainty surrounding the global and domestic outlook and the impact 
on yields, Treasury makes the following technical assumptions:  
• Over the forward estimates, government bond yields are fixed at rates observed 
immediately prior to the Budget update.  
• After the forward estimates, the 10 -year bond yield converges linearly towards the 
long -run nominal GDP growth rate over 15  years. This is broadly consistent with the 
approaches of comparable advanced economies. The yields on other bond tenors are 
assumed to maintain their historical relativity to the 10 -year bond yield.  
The higher yield assumption has bond yields increasing by 100  basis  points by 
30 June  2026. Yields are then held constant over the remainder of the forward estimates to 
2028–29, before linearly converging to the long -run yield assumption of nominal GDP 
growth over 15  years. The lower yield sensitivity is symmetric (Chart  7.14). Other economic 
parameters are assumed to remain unchanged from baseline forecasts to isolate the direct 
impact on fiscal aggregates.

Higher yields increase public debt interest payments and receipts earned on investments. 
As government interest bearing liabilities usually exceed interest bearing assets, higher Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 7: Forecasting Performance and Sensitivity Analysis  | Page 187 
yields lead to a deterioration in the underlying cash balance. Lower yields have the reverse 
effect, improving the underlying cash balance.  
The higher yield assumption results in a deterioration to the underlying cash balance of 
0.3 percentage  points of GDP by 20 35–36 and increases gross debt by 2.1 percentage  points 
of GDP at 30  June  2036 (Chart  7.15). 
The lower yield assumption results in an improvement to the underlying cash balance of 
0.2 percentage  points of GDP by  2035–36. Under the lower yield assumption, cumulative 
improvements to the underlying cash balance reduce gross debt by 2.1 percentage  points of 
GDP at 30  June  2036.

Statement 8: Statement of Risks  | Page 193 Statement 8: Statement of Risks  
Overview  
The forward estimates of revenue and expenses in the  2025–26 Budget incorporate 
assumptions and judgments based on the best information available at the time of 
publication, together with a range of economic assumptions and other forecasts and 
projections.  
Events that could affect fiscal outcomes include:  
• changes in economic and other parameters, which may be  driven by changes to the 
outlook for domestic and global growth and inflation, volatility in global commodity 
prices, impacts from rising trade tensions, further global instability stemming from 
conflicts in Europe and the  Middle East, and the challenges associated with the 
transition towards net  zero  emissions  
• matters not included in the fiscal forecasts because of uncertainty about their timing, 
magnitude or likelihood  
• the realisation of contingent liabilities or assets.  
The revenue and expense estimates and projections published in the 2025–26 Budget  are 
based on a range of economic and other parameters that are consistent with the domestic 
and international outlook detailed in Statement  2: Economic Outlook . Economic outcomes 
that differ from the parameters used in the Budget  represent a material risk to the Budget 
estimates. Statement 7: Forecasting Performance and  Sensitivity Analysis  examines the impact 
on receipts and payments of altering some of the key economic assumptions underlying  the 
Budget estimates.  
Expenditure  can differ from forecasts for program specific reasons. Forecasts of payments 
for demand -driven programs, such as payments related to Aged Care, Child Care or the 
National Disability Insurance Scheme, are highly dependent on estimates of the number of 
expected participants or beneficiaries and  estimates of the cost of providing services to 
different cohorts of participants . These can be affected by administrative decisions 
associated with these programs. Decisions made by courts, tribunals and o ther 
legal/statutory bodies (such as through the Fair Work Commission) can also affect the cost 
of activities funded by the Government.  
Revenue forecasting relies heavily on the observed relationships between the economy, 
tax bases and tax revenues. Such relationships may shift over time as the economy changes, 
presenting risk to the estimates. For example, the ability of entities to use t ax losses to offset 
profits may continue to pose heightened challenges in estimating the profile for company 
and resource tax receipts. Revenue forecasts also incorporate costings for new policies that 
typically involve a degree of uncertainty.   | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 194 | Statement 8: Statement of Risks  
The estimates and projections of revenue are also subject to general risks that can affect 
taxation collections. These risks include the ability of the tax system to keep pace with 
changes in the business environment, the potential for tax avoidance, pendi ng court 
decisions and Australian Taxation Office rulings, and the uncertain outcomes of 
compliance programs. The manifestation of these risks may result in a shift in the 
composition of taxation collected from the various tax bases or a change in the size  of 
the tax base.  
Many agencies rely on external revenue to fund the delivery of some of their services. 
Estimates included in the 2025–26 Budget  for these agencies reflect the latest information 
about the likely amount of external revenue they will raise. The external revenue actually 
collected is not certain and depends on some common factors, including economic 
conditions, which can affect estima tes for individual agencies and for the Budget as a 
whole.  
The forward estimates in the 2025–26 Budget  include the impact of all policy decisions, 
including those that remain unlegislated. This includes the impact of policy decisions that 
have been made but where negotiations remain underway or implementation details are 
still being finalised. There are ri sks to the fiscal position where legislation is not passed in 
time, where negotiations deliver outcomes that go beyond the funding offer or where final 
implementation details affect the timing or quantum of expect ed payments.  
The risks associated with climate change  
Over time, climate change is expected to have a significant impact on the Budget, both in 
terms of risk s and opportunities. The Australian Government is managing these impacts by 
reducing emissions and supporting the economic opportunities presented by the net zero 
transition. However, there is still significant uncertainty about the trajectory of global 
greenhouse gas emissions and the impacts climate change will have on Australia.  
Climate change can affect macroeconomic and fiscal outcomes in various ways. These 
include the physical impacts of climate change, the indirect impacts climate change will 
have on Australia ’s industry mix, and the impacts of policy responses to reduce emissions 
or adapt to the impacts of a changing climate. Each of these has the potential to affect 
receipts, payments, and the Australian Government ’s balance sheet. They also have the 
potential to influence general economic outcomes, which may, in turn, affec t 
Budget  outcomes .  
This  Statement  sets out specific risks where they may have an impact on the Budget in the 
Budget year or over the forward estimates period. Some of these risks, such as those 
associated with the cyclone and related flooding reinsurance pool and disaster recovery 
arrange ments, are likely to be exacerbated by climate change over time. Other specific risks 
may emerge that will impact the Budget beyond the forward estimates period.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 8: Statement of Risks  | Page 195 
Special ist Investment Vehicles  
Successive Australian Governments have established Specialist Investment Vehicles (SIVs) 
to achieve policy outcomes. These include the National Reconstruction Fund  Corporation , 
Export Finance Australia, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and the Northern 
Australia Infrastructure Facility. These SIVs have been established with robust governance 
arrangements, including independent boards, which are charged with making investment 
decisions that  manage risk and deliver outcomes in line with each SIV ’s legislative 
framework . Details of each SIV is set out in Budget Paper No.  2 or Appendix A to the 
MYEFO when they are established and, where relevant, presented in the 
‘Government  loans’ section of t his Statement, including the total value of loans issued by 
each entity. This Statement includes reference to specific risks associated with these SIVs at 
the time it is apparent that the impact of those risks associated with the investments exceed 
or are expected to exceed the materiality threshold  of $20  million in any one year , or 
$50 million over the forward estimates.  
Specific risks to the Budget  
The Budget is subject to contingent liabilities. Many of these reflect indemnities, including 
those relating to the Department of Defence, the Future  Fund Management Agency and 
Future Fund Board of Guardians, and the Reserve  Bank  of Australia. The 
Australi an Government has also issued guarantees, including those relating to guarantee 
schemes for the banking and financial sector, payments by Export Finance Australia, and 
the superannuation liabilities of the Commonwealth Bank prior to its sale. Other signifi cant 
contingent liabilities relate to uncalled capital subscriptions and credit facilities to 
international financial institutions and legal cases concerning the Australian  Government. 
The Government has robust and conservative strategies in place to reduc e its potential 
exposure to these contingent liabilities.  
Table  8.1 outlines how fiscal risks, assets and liabilities, and contingent assets and liabilities, 
are disclosed in the Budget .  
Table  8.2 summarises fiscal risks, contingent liabilities and contingent assets with a possible 
impact on the forward estimates greater than  the materiality threshold of  $20 million in any 
one year, or $50  million over the forward estimates period. Risks that are new or that have 
materially changed are detailed by portfolio after Table  8.2.  
The Australian  Government ’s annual consolidated financial statements and the annual 
financial statements of departments and other Government entities also set out information 
on contingent liabilities and contingent assets.  
The Government also makes direct loans for policy purposes. All loans contain some 
element of credit risk (that is, they will not be repaid in full) although, in many cases, this 
risk is small. Details of Government loans estimated to  exceed $200  million at 30  June  2025 
are included at the conclusion o f this Statement .  | Budget Paper No. 1

Contingent liabilities – unquantifiable  
Commonwealth liabilities in respect of matching payments to industries for 
research and development contributions  
Under several Acts, the Commonwealth provides matching contributions to encourage 
expenditure on research and development (R&D) and to increase the competitiveness and 
sustainability of industries within Australia. Matching contributions on eligible R&D ar e 
subject to an annual limit that is calculated based on the determined gross value of 
production (GVP cap) for the industries. There will be a R&D excess, which can be 
claimable in future years, where the cumulative R&D expenditure is more than the 
GVP  cap. The Commonwealth ’s future liability in respect of the matching contributions is 
contingent on the GVP  cap and is therefore unquantifiable.  
Emergency pest and disease response arrangements  
National emergency response arrangements for animal, plant and environmental pest and 
disease incursions are largely funded through cost -sharing agreements between 
Australian  governments and affected agricultural industry bodies. Under the terms of the 
emergency response cost -sharing agreements, the Australian Government is typically liable 
for 50  per cent of the total government funding for a nationally agreed response to a pest or 
disease incursion. Funding is provided in the forward estimates for the 
Australian  Government ’s contributions under the emergency response agreements, which 
are then paid to the state or territory governments undertaking relevant activities.  
There are currently 1 5 national cost -shared emergency responses . Since the 2024 –25 Budget, 
the Australian Government has provided an additional $ 249.6 million for High 
Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI) H7 and H5N1 preparedness and response activities, 
including $95.0 million across the agriculture, environment and health portfolios to manage 
the increased risk of an incursion  of HPAI H5N1 . A new national agreement  is being 
developed to manage cross -sectoral governance and cost -sharing agreements.  
The Australian, state and territory governments have developed a draft Aquatic Emergency 
Animal Disease Deed (the Deed) covering aquatic emergency animal diseases and have 
consulted prospective industry signatories. If the Deed is finalised, liabilities fo r the 
Australian Government could increase . The extent of these liabilities will depend on which 
parties sign the Deed and what emergency aquatic incursions occur that would be subject 
to the Deed arrangements.   Budget Paper No. 1  |

Significant but remote contingency  
Indemnities relating to the Air Security Officer Capability  
The Australian Government has provided an indemnity to two  Australian airlines 
connected with agreements to allow Air Security Officers on board their aircraft. The 
indemnities are limited to $2  billion  per incident. The indemnity only applies where the 
airline(s) can establish that loss, damage or claim resulted from an act by an Air Security 
Officer, under or in connection with the Air Security Officer program. The indemnity 
applies to the extent that any loss, damage or claim is not covered by existing r elevant 
insurance policies held by the airline.  
Contingent liabilit ies – unquantifiable  
Investor -state claims against the Australian  Government  
On 28 March 2023, t he Commonwealth received a notice of arbitration from Singapore 
registered company Zeph Investments Pte Ltd (Zeph) concerning a dispute about the 
Iron Ore Processing (Mineralogy Pty Ltd) Agreement Amendment Act  2020 (WA).  Zeph 
raised  this claim under Chapter 11 (Investment) of the Agreement Establishing the 
ASEAN -Australia -New  Zealand Free Trade Area  (AANZFTA) .  
Subsequently, the Commonwealth received three further notices of arbitration from Zeph. 
The first concerns a dispute about exploration permits held by Waratah Coal Pty Ltd 
(Waratah) in the Galilee Basin of Queensland. The second concerns a dispute about a coal 
mine proposed by Waratah in the Galilee Basin. The third concerns a dispute about a 
coal-fired power station proposed by Waratah in the Galilee Basin. Zeph raised each of 
these claims under Chapter  11 (Investment) of the AANZFTA.  
Should the Australian Government be unsuccessful in these proceedings, it would be liable 
for any compensation found to be payable to Zeph. Any such potential liability cannot be 
quantified at this stage.  
Native Title costs  
The Australian Government will likely be liable for any compensation found to be payable 
under the Native Title Act  1993 in respect of compensable acts for which the Australian 
Government  is responsible. While the High Court ’s decision in the Timber  Creek  litigation 
(Northern Territory v Griffiths et al  [2019]  HCA  7) provides guidance on the principles for 
calculating compensation under the Native  Title  Act, the Australian  Government ’s liability  
cannot  be quantified  owing  to uncertainty  about  the number  and effect of compensable 
acts, and the value of Native Title affected by those  acts.   | Budget Paper No. 1

Contingent asset – unquantifiable  
Civil penalty relating to the  Anti-Money Laundering and Counter -Terrorism 
Financing Act  2006  – The Star Pty  Limited  and The Star Entertainment QLD  
Limited  
On 30 November 2022, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre applied to 
the Federal Court of Australia for a civil penalty order against The  Star Pty Limited and 
The Star Entertainment QLD Limited for alleged serious contraventions of the Anti -Money 
Laundering and Counter -Terrorism Financing Act  2006   (AML/CTF Act)  including failures to 
properly assess money laundering and terrorism financing risks, and failures to undertake 
appropriate customer due diligence. The matter remains ongoing  and any potential 
penalties are unquantifiable at this time .  
Civil penalty relating to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter -Terrorism 
Financing Act  2006  – Entain Group Pty Ltd  
On 16 December  2024, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre 
(AUSTRAC) applied to the Federal Court of Australia for a civil penalty order against 
Entain Group Pty Ltd (Entain) for alleged serious and systemic non -compliance with the 
Anti -Money Laundering and Counter -Terrorism Financing Act  2006  (AML/CTF Act).  
AUSTRAC alleges that Entain failed to comply with obligations under the AML/CTF Act, 
including failures to develop and maintain a compliant anti -money laundering program 
and failure to properly assess money laundering and terrorism financing risks. The 
outcome of this matter is unknown, including whether any penalties will be imposed by 
the Court and, if so, the quantum of any penalties.   Budget Paper No. 1  |

Fiscal Risk  
Snowy Hydro Limited  
The Australian  Government has committed to provide additional financial support to 
Snowy Hydro Limited to support the delivery of the Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project and 
the Hunter Power Project. These projects will improve the security and reliability of t he 
National Electricity Market by providing reliable, dispatchable power and large -scale 
energy storage. Project risks for both projects include potential construction delays, cost 
pressures and cash flow forecasts.  
The Government continues to monitor these risks through engagement and oversight of 
Snowy Hydro Limited.  
Significant but remote contingenc ies 
Snowy Hydro Limited – Board Members ’ indemnity  
The Australian  Government  has provided an indemnity for some of the  Directors of 
Snowy  Hydro Limited to protect them against certain claims relating to their employment 
as Directors. Until the indemnity agreements are varied or ceased, they will remain as 
contingent and unquantifiable liabilities.  
Snowy Hydro Limited – Termination of the Equity Subscription Agreements  
The Australian  Government will provide sufficient funding to cover costs and liabilities 
incurred by Snowy Hydro Limited for the delivery of Snowy 2.0, capped to the total 
remaining undrawn equity, in the event that the Commonwealth terminates the 
Equity  Subscription Agreements between the Commonwealth and Snowy Hydro Limited.   
Contingent liabilities – unquantifiable  
Gorgon liquefied natural gas and carbon dioxide storage project – 
long -term  liability  
The Australian and Western Australian (WA) Governments have provided an indemnity to 
the Gorgon Joint Venture Partners (GJV) against independent third -party claims (relating to 
stored carbon dioxide) under common law, for loss or damage caused by the injection of 
carbon dioxide into the Dupuy formation under Barrow Island, WA. Claims can only occur 
at least 15  years after the cessation of carbon dioxide injections into the formation. The 
project commenced in 2019 and has an expected life of around 40  years.  The claims are 
subject to conditions similar to those set out in the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas 
Storage Act  2006 . 
The WA Government has indemnified the GJV and, subject to certain conditions being met, 
the Australian  Government has indemnified the WA Government for 80  per cent of any 
amount determined to be payable under that indemnity.   | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 206 | Statement 8: Statement of Risks  
Liability for costs incurred in a national liquid fuel emergency  
The Australian  Government has responsibility for the Liquid Fuel Emergency Act  1984  
(the Liquid Fuel Act). In addition, the Australian  Government  and state and territory 
governments have entered into an inter -governmental agreement (IGA) in 2006 in relation 
to a national liquid fuel emergency. Under the IGA, the Australian  Government  agrees to 
consult IGA parties on a likely shortage and, if necessary after those consultations, to 
advise the Governor -General of the Commonwealth of Australia to declare a nat ional 
emergency under the Act.  
The IGA contains three areas where the Australian  Government may incur expenses in 
the unlikely event of a national liquid fuel emergency. These relate to the direct costs 
of managing a liquid fuel emergency and include the possibility of the 
Australian  Government reimbursing the state and territory governments for costs arising 
from their responses, and potential compensation for industry arising from 
Australian  Government directions under the Liquid Fuel Act.  
Marinus Link Project – Shareholders ’ agreement  
The Australian  Government, along with the Victorian and the Tasmanian Governments, 
has invested in the joint venture entity Marinus Link Pty Ltd to deliver the Marinus Link 
project. If the three shareholders decide not to proceed with the project and Marin us Link 
Pty Ltd is wound up, the shareholders may be required to contribute additional equity to 
meet any outstanding liabilities of Marinus Link Pty Ltd.  
Under the shareholders ’ agreement, the Tasmanian Government also has the option to 
sell some or all of its shares to the other shareholders. This option can only be exercised 
following the commencement of commercial operations of stage one of the project, 
currently scheduled for  2030. While the Victorian Government has the first right of refusal 
to purchase these shares (capped at 16.7  per cent of the Tasmanian Government ’s 
17.7 per cent of the shareholdings), the Australian  Government is required to purcha se the 
shares that the Victorian Government does not acquire. Any additional shares purchased 
would be expected to generate a return in line with the Australian  Government ’s existing 
shareholding in the entity.  
There are also ongoing project risks as the project progresses, such as cost pressures, 
that may require additional financial support from the shareholders. The 
Australian  Government will continue to monitor these risks through engagement and 
oversight of Marinus Link Pty Ltd ’s activities.  
Murray Darling Basin Reform – risk assignment  
The Australian  Government has committed to bridge the gap between the Baseline 
Diversion Limit and the Sustainable Diversion Limits in the  Murray -Darling  Basin 
Plan  2012 through water recovery. On 1  July 2019, the Sustainable Diversion Limits took 
effect. The Water  Act 2007  provides a risk assignment framework in which entitlement 
holders with reductions in water allocations, or changes in the reliability of water Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 8: Statement of Risks  | Page 207 
allocations (where the gap has not been bridged and an accredited water resource plan is in 
place), may be eligible for a payment from the Commonwealth.  
The total cost of the operation of the risk assignment framework cannot be quantified at 
this time and remains a fiscal risk until the gap between the Baseline Diversion Limit and 
Sustainable Diversion Limits is fully bridged.  
Remediation  of Jabiru Township  
The Australian  Government, the Northern Territory Government, Gundjeihmi Aboriginal 
Corporation and Energy Resources of Australia Ltd signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding in  2019. The Memorandum of Understanding underpins the transfer of 
ownership of Jabir u to the Traditional Owners and related make good and rehabilitation 
arrangements. On 26  June  2021, the Australian  Government officially returned ownership 
of Jabiru to the Traditional Owners. Before the handover, the Australian  Government 
signed a Remedia tion and Indemnity Deed between representatives of the Traditional 
Owners in Jabiru and the Northern Land Council.  
Under these agreements, the Australian  Government ’s responsibilities include renewal or 
upgrading of some essential services infrastructure (stormwater, landfill and roads), 
managing contamination in Jabiru  Lake, management or removal of hazardous materials 
and chemicals, replacing asbestos tiled roofs an d improving housing stock, and other 
ecological remediation. Expenditure for the rehabilitation work will be shared between the 
Australian  Government, Northern Territory Government and Energy Resources Aust ralia.  
United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve Lease Agreement – indemnity under 
certain conditions  
On 3  June  2020, the Australian  Government  entered into a commercial leasing agreement 
with the United States  (US) Department of Energy. This agreement facilitates the storage of 
Australia ’s first government -owned strategic fuel reserve in the US Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve  (SPR).  
Under the lease agreement, the Australian  Government indemnifies the SPR for any 
liabilities incurred (subject to certain exceptions) arising from or related to: the 
transportation of crude oil to the SPR; third -party claims made in connection with the 
drawdown or delivery of the oil; and customs duties, fees or other charges which may arise 
from the Australian  Government ’s noncompliance with US Customs Law.  
Following the sale and delivery of all Australian oil held in the  SPR in  June  2022, the risk of 
any liability is currently significantly reduced. Australia continues to maintain its lease and 
could decide to store new reserves in the future.   | Budget Paper No. 1

Contingent liabilities  – quantifiable  
Capacity Investment Scheme  
The Australian Government has announced six projects through the South Australia and 
Victoria tender to enter into underwriting agreements under the Capacity Investment 
Scheme. These underwritings are expected to generate 3.62  gigawatt  hours  (GWh) in 
storage capacity.  
The Australian Government announced a further 19 projects to enter into underwriting 
agreements through CIS Tender 1 – National Electricity Market (NEM) Generation, 
providing storage capacity of 3.56  GWh and generating 6.38 gigawatts of renewable energy 
to the NEM.  
The Australian Government has also announced four projects to enter into underwriting 
agreements through CIS Tender 2 – Wholesaler Electricity Market Dispatchable, in Western 
Australia . The projects have a combined capacity of around 2.6 GWh in storage capacity.  
Under the terms of these underwriting agreements, once the projects are built and 
operational, if the annual revenue earned by a project is below the agreed revenue floor, the 
Australian Government will pay the project operator 90  per cent of the revenue s hortfall up 
to the agreed annual cap for 15 years. If annual revenue earned by a project exceeds the 
agreed ceiling, the project operator pays the Australian Government 50  per cent of revenue 
above the ceiling up to the agreed cap.  
The Australian Government ’s maximum liability and estimated payments under these 
agreements are not for publication due to commercial sensitivities. While estimated 
payments are not for publication, they are reflected in the forward estimates from  2026–27. 
Final payments will depend on future electricity prices and the resulting impact on project 
revenues.  
Any a dditional specific risks associated with this program will be reflected in the Statement  
of Risks  once further contracts are finalised and if it is determined that they meet the 
materiality thresholds for inclusion.  
Underwriting of the Marinus Link Project  
The Australian Government has underwritten up to A$165.75  million for the Cancellation 
Fee payable for the Cable Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) Contract for 
the Marinus Link project (signed 31  July 2024).  
The condition for this underwriting agreement to be called on relates to agreement to 
proceed with the project not being reached and the associated notices to proceed not being 
issued to the cable contractors by 31  August  2025.   Budget Paper No. 1  |

Fiscal Risks  
Implementation of the nuclear -powered submarine program  
On 14  March  2023, the Australian  Government, alongside the governments of the 
United  Kingdom and the United States of America, announced the optimal pathway for 
the nuclear -powered submarine program for Australia under the AUKUS trilateral security 
partnership.  
The Australian  Government has agreed a number of measures to support the initial 
implementation of the nuclear -powered submarine program, which have been outlined in 
Budget papers since 2023 –24.  
The total costs associated with the program will depend on the details of design and 
production processes and commercial and other arrangements, including the provision of 
indemnities, which will be finalised between governments and delivery partners.  
Major operations of the Australian Defence Force in 2025–26 
The 202 5–26 estimates for the Department of Defence  (Defence)  include the cost of major 
operations of the Australian Defence Force in  2025–26 in the Middle East region, and to 
protect Australia ’s borders and offshore maritime interests. Funding for major Defence 
operations is considered and provisioned on a year -by-year  basis.  
Significant but remote contingenc ies 
ADI Limited – Officers ’ and Directors ’ indemnities  
Under the sale agreements for ADI  Limited, the Australian  Government agreed to 
indemnify the directors, officers and employees of ADI  Limited for claims and legal costs 
associated with assistance related to the sale of the Australian  Government ’s shares in the 
company. The Australian  Government has also provided an indemnity to ADI  Limited for 
uninsured losses relating to specific heads of claims.  
Litigation cases  
Defence is involved in a wide range of litigation and other claims for compensation and/or 
damages that may result in litigation where the matters are not able to be finalised by 
negotiation.  
The litigation includes:  
• common law liability claims, including for personal injury and property damage, 
investigations of Defence  by Comcare and active prosecutions in relation  to alleged  
breaches of the Work  Health and Safety  Act 2011   | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 210 | Statement 8: Statement of Risks  
• claims seeking compensation for alleged loss or damage arising from Defence use 
of aqueous film forming  foam that contained manmade per - and poly -fluoroalkyl 
(PFAS) substances  
• claims received  following reviews into the Australian Defence Force and Defence 
culture.  
Claims may also arise from the disposal of assets to third parties where such assets contain 
hazardous materials, or components that have the potential to cause injury.  
Remote contingencies  
As at 30 June 2024, Defence carried 412 instances of quantifiable remote contingent 
liabilities valued at $7.95  billion  and 592 instances of unquantifiable remote contingent 
liabilities.  
Details of these significant but remote contingent liabilities are not given due to commercial 
and/or national security sensitivities.  
Contingent liabilities – unquantifiable  
Cockatoo Island Dockyard  
On 13  October  2001, Cockatoo Island Dockyard  commenced proceedings against the 
Commonwealth in the New  South  Wales  (NSW) Supreme  Court seeking full 
reimbursement from the Australian  Government for personal injury claims costs 
incurred  after 31  October  1995 in relation to asbestos exposure. Following decisions 
in the NSW  Supreme  Court on 17  December  2004 and 4  February  2005, and the 
NSW  Court  of Appeal on 23  November  2006, Cockatoo Island Dockyard  was awarded 
a complete indemnity from the Commonwealth for it s uninsured exposure to asbestos 
damages claims, plus profit of 7.5  per cent. Defence continues to manage reimbursement 
of claims costs incurred by Cockatoo Island Dockyard.  
Land decontamination, site restoration and decommissioning of Defence assets  
Defence has made a financial provision for the estimated costs involved in remediating 
contaminated land on the Defence estate where a legal or constructive obligation has 
arisen. For cases where these obligations do not exist, or these contingencies are 
unquantified, a provision has not been made.   
Contingent liability  – quantifiable  
Claims against the Department of Defence  
The Department of Defence (Defence) has 15 instances of non -remote, quantifiable 
contingent liabilities in respect of claims against Defence valued at $17.9  million .  
The estimated figure is determined by an objective analysis of the probable amount payable 
for all matters managed by firms engaged by Defence using the Attorney -General’s Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 8: Statement of Risks  | Page 211 
Whole  of Australian Government Legal Services Panel and those being handled in -house 
by Defence Legal Division. However, the exact amount payable under those claims is

Employment and Workplace Relations  
Fiscal Risk  
Recovery of inappropriately claimed VET FEE -HELP payments from 
VET providers  
The Australian Government is undertaking compliance action, including court action, 
to recover VET  FEE-HELP payments from VET  providers where loans were issued 
inappropriately to students by providers. The Government has legislated a remedy, 
which  commenced 1  January  2019, for VET  FEE–HELP students who incurred debts under 
the VET FEE -HELP loan scheme following inappropriate conduct by VET  providers. 
The Government will undertake recovery activities against VET  providers in cases where 
the student was ineligibl e for a VET FEE -HELP loan.  
There are financial risks to the Commonwealth in the event that it cannot recover payments 
from VET providers where they have closed or entered into administration or liquidation.  
The financial risk to the Commonwealth is currently unquantifiable as it depends on the 
receipt and assessment of applications from students, as well as outcomes from the 
Government ’s investigations into VET providers ’ conduct.  
Contingent liabilit y – unquantifiable  
Indemnity provided to the Administrator of the Construction and General 
Division of the Construction, Forestry and Maritime Employees Union  
The Commonwealth intends to enter into a deed of indemnity with the Administrator of 
the Construction and General Division (and its branches) of the Construction, Forestry and 
Maritime Employees Union. The indemnity is to ensure that, in the event relevant 
provisions in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009  and/or the Fair Work 
(Registered Organisations) (CFMEU Construction and General Division Administration) 
Determination 2024  (which contain an indemnity) are found to be invalid, the Administrator 
and persons acting under his direction have continued indemnity in certain circumstances. 
The proposed indemnity is uncapped for certain liabilities (although subject to compliance 
with its terms) and currently unquantifiable as the potential liability cannot be accurately 
estimated at present.  
Contingent liabilit ies – quantifiable  
Parent Pathways service  
Parent Pathways is a voluntary pre -employment service which commenced on 
1 November  2024. Parent Pathways supports parents and carers of children under six to 
work towards their employment and education goals, while valuing the important role of 
caring for children.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 8: Statement of Risks  | Page 213 
Participants can access financial assistance through the Individual and Pooled Funds. The 
Individual Fund provides participants with financial assistance to build their skills and 
capabilities and to attend appointments or activities. A notional amount of $1,250 is 
credited to each participant ’s Individual Fund on their commencement in the service. Every 
12 months unused credits will lapse, and a new $1,250 credit will be applied to the 
participant ’s Individual Fund. The Pooled Fund supplements the Individu al Fund and 
supports a broad range of purchases for participants who are in most need of assistance. 
When a participant commences, $600 is allocated to the provider ’s Pooled Fund.  
As the service has only recently commenced, providers are forecast to spend less than the 
value of the available credits, creating a surplus of credits that present a contingent liability. 
As at 31  December  2024, there was $11.7  million in unspent credits in the Individual and 
Pooled Fund notional banks.  
ParentsNext program  
ParentsNext supported parents to identify their education and employment related goals to 
build their work readiness, and plan and prepare for employment by the time their 
youngest child starts school.  The program ceased on 31  October  2024.  
Under the program, providers accumulated one -off credits which accrued to their 
provider ’s Participation Fund on commencement of a participant.  
Currently, providers are forecast to spend less than the value of the available credits, 
creating a surplus of credits that present a contingent liability. As at 31  December  2024, 
there was $ 80.8 million in unspent Participation Fund credits in the Participation Fund 
notional bank. The surplus of credits will decline as providers seek reimbursement for 
funds expended before the ParentsNext program  ceased on 31  October  2024 . 
The new voluntary pre -employment service for parents, Parent Pathways, commenced on 
1 November  2024.  
Workforce Australia – Employment Fund   
Since  July 2022, with the introduction of Workforce Australia, contracted service providers 
and the Digital Services Contact Centre have had access to the Employment Fund, which 
can be used to purchase goods and services to help participants to get and kee p a job.  
• Providers accumulate a $1,600 Employment Fund credit upon commencement of each 
participant in Workforce Australia Provider Services. This will reduce to $1,500 from 
1 July 2025 as part of the 2024 –25 Budget  measure Employment Services Reform  – 
Supporting Jobseekers Through Paid Employment Pathways Package  – Real Jobs, Real Wages . 
The Employment Fund credit remains at $1,600 for Broome Employment Services and 
Yarrabah Employment Services  as these two services have different policy and program 
settings .  | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 214 | Statement 8: Statement of Risks  
• Participants in Workforce Australia Online attract an Employment Fund credit, credited 
after a participant has been in Digital Services for two months. The credit amount 
reduced from $300 to $250 in June 2024 as part of the 2024 –25 Budget  measure 
Employment Services Reform  – Supporting Jobseekers Through Paid Employment Pathways 
Package  – Real Jobs, Real Wages . New credits have been paused for the duration of the 
2025 calendar year  as part of the 2024 –25 MYEFO measure  Temporarily Pausing Workforce 
Australia Online Employment Fund Credits.  
Currently, Employment Fund expenditure is expected to be less than the value of the 
available credits, creating an accumulating surplus of credits that present a contingent 
liability. As at 31 December  2024, there was $ 670.9 million in unspent Employment Fund 
Credits in the Workforce Australia Employment Fund notional bank  (this includes 
Workforce Australia Online Employment Fund , Workforce Australia Services Employment 
Fund,  Broome Employment Services Employment Fund and Yarrabah Employment 
Services Employ ment Fund) .   Budget Paper No. 1  |

Significant but remote contingency  
Australian Naval Infrastructure Pty Ltd – Termination of the Equity 
Funding  Agreement  
The Australian Government will provide sufficient funding to enable Australian Naval 
Infrastructure Pty Ltd (ANI) to meet the direct costs that may be incurred by ANI in the 
event that the Commonwealth terminates the Equity Funding Agreement entered into 
in October  2017 between the Commonwealth and ANI.  
Contingent liabilities – unquantifiable  
ASC Pty Ltd – Directors ’ and Executives ’ indemnities  
In 2002, the Australian Government provided former directors of the then Australian 
Submarine Corporation Pty Ltd (now known as ASC Pty Ltd (ASC)) with indemnities for:  
• any claim against them as a result of complying with ASC ’s obligations under the 
Process Agreement between the Electric Boat Corporation (EBC), the 
Australian  Government and ASC  
• any claim against them as a result of  complying with ASC ’s obligations under the 
Service Level Agreement between ASC, the Department of Defence, EBC and 
Electric  Boat Australia  
• any claims and legal costs arising from the directors acting in accordance with the 
Board’s tasks and responsibilities, as defined under the indemnity.  
In 2018, the Australian Government provided directors and senior executives of ASC with 
indemnities to mitigate personal risk and provide coverage for legal costs related to any 
legal proceedings that may arise in relation to the transaction to separate AS C Shipbuilding 
Pty Limited from ASC.  
ASC Pty Ltd – Guarantee of Indemnity from ASC in favour of ASC Shipbuilding 
Pty Limited  
The Australian Government has provided a guarantee of an indemnity from ASC Pty Ltd 
(ASC) in favour of ASC Shipbuilding Pty Limited (ASC Shipbuilding).  
ASC provided an indemnity in favour of ASC Shipbuilding prior to ASC Shipbuilding 
being separated from ASC Pty Ltd, which occurred in  December  2018. This indemnity is 
intended to cover any liabilities unknown at the time of separation which may arise after  
separation. The indemnity is time limited to seven years.   | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 216 | Statement 8: Statement of Risks  
The guarantee will only be called on if ASC is no longer owned by the Commonwealth and 
ASC can no longer meet its obligations under the terms of the indemnity. It is 
Australian  Government policy to retain ASC as a Government Business Enterprise.  
Australian Government general insurance fund – Comcover  
The Department of Finance provides insurance and risk management services to 
Australian  Government general government sector entities. Insurance liabilities are subject 
to potential revisions as the total number and size of claims covered is subject to unforeseen 
future events.  
The Department of Finance takes all reasonable steps to ensure it has appropriate 
information regarding its claims exposure, including regularly updating estimates and 
parameters based on analysis of claim experience, actuarial calculations and other relev ant 
factors.  
Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation – immunity and indemnity  
The Governance of Australian Government Superannuation Schemes Act 2011  (the Governance 
Act) provides specific immunities for activities undertaken in good faith by directors and 
delegates of the board of the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation (CSC), provided 
these activities relate to the performance of their functions.  
Under the Governance Act, other than where not permitted by the Superannuation Industry 
(Supervision) Act 1993  or regulations under that Act, any money that becomes payable by 
CSC in respect of an action, liability, claim or demand that relates to the superannuation 
schemes or funds for which it is responsible, is to be paid out of the relevant 
superannuation fund  or, if there is no fund, the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF). 
Amounts paid from a superannuation fund are reimbursed to the fund from the CRF.  
Finance owned estate  
The Department of Finance owns and is responsible for managing properties in the 
Australian Government ’s domestic non -Defence portfolio, including remediation of 
contaminated sites to ensure there is no threat to human health and the environment. 
A small number of properties may require remediation and are subject to further 
investigation. Except for propert y at Lucas Heights in New  South Wales , none of the 
properties with potential remediation issues has had a provision for remediation 
recognised, as neith er the conditions for legal nor constructive obligations have been met, 
nor is a reliable estimate of the obligation currently  possible.  
Future Fund Management Agency and Future Fund Board of Guardians – 
indemnity  
The Australian Government has provided certain staff members of the Future Fund 
Management Agency (the Agency) and the members (board members) of the Future Fund 
Board of Guardians (the Board) with deeds of indemnity. The indemnities are intended to 
cover liabilities in excess of the insurance cover (including Comcover) of the Board, its Budget Paper No. 1  |

arising out of an act, omission or breach of statutory duty by the Board or a board member 
that relates to the performance of the Board ’s functions or the exercise of the Board ’s 
powers or that relates to any act, omission or breach of statutory duty by a board member 
as a director or officer of a wholly -owned Australian subsidiary of the Board.  
Certain Agency staff members are indemnified in connection with the performance of 
functions or the exercise of powers in their capacity as a director or officer of investee 
companies or subsidiaries of the Board. Subject to certain exceptions or qualifica tions, 
board members and Agency staff members are indemnified for amounts up to the value 
of the relevant funds.  
Board members are not indemnified in respect of any liability owed by them to the Board 
or its subsidiary, or which results from a contravention of a civil penalty provision of the 
Future Fund Act 2006 or the  Corporations Act 2001.  Agency staff members are not 
indemnified to the extent they are indemnified by the relevant investee company or 
subsidiary, in respect of any liability owed to the Board or the Commonwealth, or to the 
extent that they are granted and receive financial ass istance under Appendix E of the  
Legal  Services Directions 2017 . Both board members and Agency staff members are not 
indemnified for any liability resulting from conduct they engage in other than in good 
faith, to the extent they recover a liability under a Directors and Officers insurance policy

defending or resisting criminal proceedings or proceedings regarding a contravention of 
a civil penalty provision.  
Googong Dam  
On 4  September  2008, a 150 -year  lease for Googong  Dam was signed between the 
Australian  Government and the Australian Capital Territory  (ACT) Government. The 
Australian  Government is liable to pay just terms compensation if the terms of the lease 
are breached by introducing new legislation or changing the Canberra Water Supply 
(Googong  Dam) Act  1974  in a way that impacts on the rights of the  ACT. The lease includes 
a requirement for the Australian Government to undertake rectification of easements or 
any defects in title in relation to Googong Dam, and re mediation of any contamination it 
may have caused to the  site. It also gives an indemnity in relation to acts or omissions by 
the Australian Government.  
Indemnities for the Reserve Bank of Australia and private sector banks  
In accordance with Government entities ’ contracts for transactional banking services, the 
Australian Government has indemnified the Reserve Bank of Australia and contracted

Indemnities relating to other former asset sales, privatisations and information 
technology outsourcing projects  
Ongoing and terminating indemnities have been given in respect of a range of asset sales, 
privatisations and information technology outsourcing projects that have been conducted 
by the Department of Finance and the former Office of Asset Sales and Commerci al 
Support and its predecessors. The probability of an action being brought under one of these 
indemnities diminishes over time.  
Details of indemnities in respect of other asset sales and privatisations have been provided 
in previous Budget and MYEFO papers, and previous Annual Reports of the Department 
of Finance and the Office of Asset Sales and Commercial Support.

Export Finance Australia – National Interest Account  
There are five financing facilities under Export Finance Australia ’s National Interest 
Account.  
The Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP) started operation on 
1 July 2019. The AIFFP can provide up to $4.0  billion in facilities, including up to 
$1.0 billion in grants and the balance in loans and guarantees, to support hi gh priority 
infrastructure development in Pacific countries and Timor -Leste. To date, the 
Australian  Government has agreed to provide loans, guarantees and grants to support the 
development of 41  infrastructure projects in 11  countries. As at 31  January  2025, the 
maximum loan exposure is $1.1  billion, of which $2 24.7 million was drawn down.  
The Critical Minerals Facility (CMF) was established on 28  September  2021 to provide 
finance to critical minerals projects in Australia where private sector finance is unavailable 
or insufficient. In the 2023 –24 MYEFO, the Australian Government expanded the CMF by 
$2.0 billion for a maximum aggregate exposure of $4.0  billio n. To date, the Government has 
agreed to provide a total of approximately $2.63  billion to support five projects under the 
facility. As at 31  January  2025, $248.8  million was drawn down f rom the CMF.  
The Defence Export Facility (DEF) was established to grow Australia ’s defence exports by 
helping to overcome difficulties in accessing private sector finance. The DEF has a 
maximum aggregate exposure of US$3.0  billion (approximately A$4.8  billion as at 
31 January 2025). To date, three loans under the DEF have been agreed for a total signing 
value of A$228  million. As at 31  January  2025, A$16 7.9 million was outstanding .  
The COVID -19 Export Capital Facility was announced on 15  April  2020, with a maximum 
aggregate exposure of $500.0  million. The COVID -19 Export Capital Facility expired in 
April  2021. As at 31  January  2025, $0.045 million was outstanding .  
The Southeast Asia Investment Financing Facility (SEAIFF) was announced on 
5 March  2024. The SEAIFF will provide up to $2.0  billion in loans, guarantees, equity and 
insurance for projects that would boost Australian trade and investment in Southeast Asia, 
particularly in support of the region ’s clean energy transition and infrastructure 
development. In the 2024 –25 MYEFO, the Australian Government agreed to provide 
US$50.0  million (approximately A$73.2  million as at 22 September 2024) to support one 
project under the SEAIFF. As at 31 January  2025 , no funds had been drawn down .  
The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act  1991  has been amended  to enable Export 
Finance Australia to finance domestic projects in the national interest where they are 
consistent with the Future Made in Australia  National Interest  Framework. The 
Government will be able to consider supporting projects on the National Interest Account 
through financing including debt or equity, where projects are unable to progress solely 
through commercial financing.  Budget Paper No. 1  |

Export Finance Australia   
The Australian Government guarantees the due payment of money that is, or may at any 
time become, payable by Export Finance Australia to anyone other than the Government. 
As at 31 January 2025 , the Government ’s total contingent liability was $ 7.5 billion, 
comprising Export Finance Australia ’s liabilities to third parties ($ 6.4 billion) and Export

Health and Aged Care  
Fiscal Risk  
Aged Care  
The Australian Government is the principal funder of aged care services, including 
residential aged care and in -home aged care services.  
The Aged Care Act 2024  will commence on 1  July 2025 and provides the legislative basis for 
the Government ’s reforms to aged care services, including the establishment of the Support 
at Home program to deliver improved and more targeted in -home care services, and a new 
framework for participant contributions for residential aged care and in -home aged care 
services to create a more equitable and sustainable aged care system.  
As with other new demand -driven programs, there is greater potential for the estimated 
costs of the aged care programs to be subject to adjustments to reflect observed changes in 
actual payments. The estimated costs for the Support at Home program will depend on 
successful impleme ntation, demand for the new program, the level of services that care 
recipients are assessed as eligible for, the services they choose to access and the amount that 
care recipients contribute towards their costs. The observed impact of the changes to the 
contribution arrangements for care recipients in residential aged care may also impact on 
the estimated costs for residential aged care.  
Contingent liabilities – unquantifiable  
Accommodation Payment Guarantee Scheme  
The Accommodation Payment Guarantee Scheme guarantees the repayment of aged care 
residents ’ refundable accommodation payments (including refundable deposits and 
accommodation bonds) if the approved provider becomes insolvent or bankrupt and 
defaults on its refund obligations. In return for the payment, the rights that the resident 
had to recover  the amount from their approved provider are transferred to the 
Australian  Government so it can pursue the approved provider for the funds. In cases 
where the funds are unable to be recovered, the Australian  Government may levy all 
approved providers holding bonds, entry contributions and refundable accommodation 
deposits to meet  any shortfall.  
Advance Purchasing Agreements for COVID -19 vaccines  
The Australian Government has provided indemnities to the suppliers of COVID -19 
vaccines, for which the Australian Government has entered into Advance Purchasing 
Agreements, covering certain liabilities that could result from the use of the vaccines. 
These  agreements relate  to vaccines from AstraZeneca Pty Ltd, Pfizer Inc, Moderna

Australian Red Cross Society – indemnities  
Deeds of Agreement between the Australian Red Cross Society (the Red Cross) and the 
National Blood Authority in relation to the operation of Australian Red Cross Lifeblood 
and the development of principal manufacturing sites in Sydney and Melbourne, includ e 
certain indemnities and a limitation of liability in favour of the Red Cross. These 
indemnities cover defined sets of potential business, product and employee risks and 
liabilities. Certain indemnities for specific risk events that operate within the ter m of the 
Deed of Agreement are capped and must meet specified pre -conditions. Other indemnities 
and the limitation of liability only operate in the event of the expiry and non -renewal, or 
the earlier termination, of the Deed of Agreement relating to the operation of the Red Cross 
or the cessation of funding for the principal sites, and only within a certain scope. 
All indemnities are also subject to appropriate limitations and c onditions, including in 
relation to mitigation, contributory fault, and the process of handling relevant claims.  
Blood and blood products liability cover  
The National Managed Fund (NMF) was established by a memorandum of understanding 
between the Australian Government, Australian Red Cross Lifeblood (Lifeblood) and state 
and territory governments to cover potential future claims in relation to the supply of  blood 
and blood products by Lifeblood. The NMF provides for liabilities incurred by Lifeblood 
where other available mitigation or cover is not available. Under certain conditions, the 
Australian Government and the state and territory governments may joint ly provide 
indemnity for Lifeblood through a cost -sharing arrangement for claims, both current and 
potential, regarding personal injury and loss or damage suffered by a recipient of certain 
blood products. If there are insufficient funds in the NMF to cover claim costs, the 
Jurisdictional Blood Committee will consider a report provided by the National Funds 
Manager to determine the level of additional funds required. The Australian  Government ’s 
share of any additional liability is limited to 63  per cent of any agreed net cost.  
CSL Ltd  
CSL Limited (CSL) is indemnified against claims made by individuals who contract 
specified infections from specified products and against employees contracting 
asbestos -related injuries. CSL has unlimited cover for most events that occurred before 
the sale of CSL on 1  January  1994, but has more limited cover for a specified range of 
events  that occurred during the operation of the Plasma Fractionation Agreement from 
1 January  1994 to 31  December  2004. Where alternative cover was not arranged by CSL, 
the Australian  Government may have a contingent liability.  
The National Fractionation Agreement for Australia with CSL Behring (Australia) Pty Ltd 
(a subsidiary of CSL), which has operated since 1  January  2018, includes a requirement that 
the National Blood Authority make a defined payment to CSL Behring (Australi a) Pty Ltd 
in certain circumstances only, in the event that the volume of plasma supplied annually to 
CSL Behring (Australia) Pty Ltd is less than a specified amount.   | Budget Paper No. 1

Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games  – On 21  July 2021, the International 
Olympic Committee selected Brisbane to host the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games. 
On 17 February  2023, the Australian Government and the Queensland Government signed 
a bilateral agreement on matters of shared interest, i ncluding a capped capital contribution 
towards venue infrastructure by the Australian Government. The Australian  Government 
has also provided a range of guarantees to the International Olympic Committee for 
prov ision of government services in support of Brisbane hosting the Games, at no cost to 
the Organising Committee of the Olympic Games. The financial implications of this 
support are not quantifiable at this time.

2022–23 March  Budget to support event delivery and legacy programs, the Government 
has committed to provide services and support (such as security commitments and visa 
processing for participants and support staff). The financial implication of this additional 
support is not quantifiable at this time.  
2023 FIFA Women ’s World Cup  – Between 20  July 2023 and 20  August  2023, Australia and 
New Zealand co -hosted the 2023 FIFA Women ’s World Cup. In addition to the financial 
assistance provided by the Australian  Government to support direct event delivery costs 
and legacy programs, the Government committed to provide Commonwealth guarantees 
for the event including taxation exemptions. The financial implication of this additional 
support is not quantifiable at this time.  
Medical Indemnity Exceptional Claims Scheme

assumes liability for 100  per cent of any damages payable against practitioners practising in 
a medical profession that exceed a specified level of cover provided by the pract itioner’s 
medical indemnity insurer (currently $20  million). These arrangements apply to payouts 
either related to a single large claim or to multiple claims that in aggregate exceed the cover 
provided by the practitioner ’s medical indemnity insurer, and w ould apply to claims 
notified under contract -based cover since 2003. From 1  July 2020, the Medical and Midwife 
Indemnity Legislation Amendment Act  2019  provides transferred eligibility for allied health 
professionals (including registered only midwives) into the Allied Health High Cost Claims Budget Paper No. 1  |

The Department of Health and Aged Care is using debt waivers to address the creation 
of statutory debts by participants of the Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme who 
inadvertently breached contractual arrangements from 2020, when the reformed Bonded 
Medical Program was implemented. In 202 3–24, the Department of Health and Aged Care 
waived no statutory debts , however further waivers may be required. The total value of the 
waivers cannot yet be quantified.  
mRNA manufacturing facility – indemnities  
The Commonwealth has entered into a strategic partnership with Moderna  Australia Pty 
Ltd (Moderna) to establish domestic mRNA vaccine manufacturing capacity and capability 
in Australia. Under the agreement between the Commonwealth and Moderna, the 
Commonwealth may enter into a pandemic vaccine advance purchase agreement with 
Moderna for locally manufact ured mRNA vaccines in certain circumstances where an 
infectious disease pandemic is declared. Moderna will also have the capacity to supply 
the Commonwealth with non -pandemic vaccines through a non -pandemic vaccine 
supply  agreement.  
The Commonwealth does provide indemnities to Moderna under these arrangements to 
cover certain liabilities that could result from the implementation of the arrangement.  
There are also indemnities provided by Moderna in favour of the Commonwealth for 
certain liabilities, which reflect risk  sharing between the parties and are intended to limit 
financial exposure to the Australian  Government .

Contingent liabilities – unquantifiable  
Australian victims of terrorism overseas payment  
The Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Act 2012  
inserted Part 2.24AA into the Social Security Act 1991  to create a scheme to provide financial 
assistance to Australian residents who are victims of an overseas terrorist act that has been 
declared by the Prime Minister. The scheme commenced on 22  January  2013. Under the 
scheme, Australian residents who are harmed (primary victims) or whose close family 
member di es (secondary victims) as a direct result of a declare d terrorist act are eligible to 
claim one -off payments of up to $75,000. As acts of terrorism are unpredictable, and the 
declaration of overseas terrorists acts discretionary, the cost of the scheme is 
unquantifiable .  
Commonwealth Community Safety Order Scheme – Federation Funding 
Agreement – indemnity  
The Department of Home Affairs has negotiated arrangements for the Community Safety 
Order scheme and has, on behalf of the Commonwealth, entered into a Federation Funding 
Agreement (FFA) with New South Wales (NSW) ending on 30  June 2025. The FFA provides 
for delivery of services including evidence collection, specialist legal support, 
accommodation (in prison) and case management support for offenders in the community.  
The accommodation component of the services is governed by a housing agreement that 
stipulates baseline detention under a Community Safety Detention Order. The housing 
agreement indemnifies NSW, and each of its employees, officers and agents, for all costs  
reasonably sustained or incurred in the operation of the housing agreement.   
Disaster Recovery  
The Australian Government provides funding to states and territories through the 
jointly -funded Commonwealth -State Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA) to 
assist with natural disaster relief and recovery costs. A state or territory may claim DRFA Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 8: Statement of Risks  | Page 227 
funding if a natural disaster occurs and relief and recovery expenditure for that event 
meet s the thresholds set out in the DRFA.  
The forward estimates for the DRFA include preliminary estimates of costs for past events, 
based on the best information available at the time of preparation. Preliminary estimates of 
the cost of disaster relief and recovery and the timing of expenditure a re subject to change. 
The total cost of relief and recovery from past events may not be completely realised for 
several years.  
For major disasters, the Australian Government may approve payments to individuals, 
such as the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment and Disaster Recovery 
Allowance. As natural disasters and their impacts are unpredictable, the cost of these 
payments for future disasters is unquantifiable and is not included in the forward 
estimates.  
The full impact of the ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred in Queensland and New South Wales in 
early March 2025 is unknown. Any assistance provided under the DRFA, AGDRP or DRA 
may have further impacts on expenditure that are currently unquantifiable.  
Facilities, garrison, transferee arrivals and reception, and health services in the

Government support for Whyalla Steelworks  
On 19 February 2025, the South Australian  Government appointed an administrator to 
OneSteel Manufacturing Pty Ltd (OneSteel). On 20 February 2025, the Australian and South 
Australian  Governments announced joint support of $2.4  billion to stabilise and secu re the 
longer -term future of the Whyalla Steelworks, including up to $1.9  billion for the 
transformation of the Steelworks. The Australian  Government ’s funding contribution for 
immediate on the ground support and the administration process are reflected in  the 
2025–26 Budget , as is the commitment of up to $500  million of the Green Iron Investment 
Fund to support the longer -term transformation of the Steelworks. The 
Australian  Government has also committed to make additional financing contributions, 
subject to commercial negotiations, as part of the $1.9  billion joint commitment to the 
long -term transformation of the steelworks. Further funding to support an extension of the 
administration process could also be considered if necessary, but this would be sub ject to a 
future decision of government so is unable to be quantified at this time.  
Rehabilitation of the Ranger Uranium Mine  
The Australian Government approved the Ranger Uranium Mine (Ranger) in the late  1970s. 
Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA) was authorised to mine uranium at Ranger until 
2021, and is required to rehabilitate the site to achieve an environmental condition similar 
to adjacent areas. Pursuant to the renegotiated agreement between the  
Australian  Government and the Northern Land Council, the Australian  Government 
would be responsible for carrying out rehabilitation works at the Ranger site should ERA 
fail to  complete the works. ERA has provided a  rehabilitation security to the Australian 
Government to cover the expected costs of rehabilitation should it be called upon.  
The rehabilitation security is revalued periodically based on estimated rehabilitation costs 
at a point in time, and ERA may be required to provide further security if necessary 
following a revaluation. The security currently reflects valuation assumptions  as 
at March  2020. Recent assessments of the rehabilitation costs undertaken by the 
Government indicate that the potential costs have increased significantly following 
the last security valuation (in  March  2020) and that, at present, the security held by 
the Australian  Government would not be sufficient to rehabilitate the site should the 
Australian Government be required to do so. The Government acknowledges the 
uncertainty in costing rehabilitation works beyond 2027 and the impact this has on the 
timing o f the next security valuation. Until the security can be valued in light of the cost 
uncertainties being experienced by ERA, the difference between the expected rehabilitation 
costs and the security held by the Australian  Government represents a fiscal risk to 
the Budget.  Budget Paper No. 1  |

Significant but remote contingenc ies 
Liability for damages caused by space and certain high -power rocket activities  
Under the United Nations Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by 
Space Objects, the Australian Government may be liable to pay compensation for damage 
caused to nationals of other countries by space objects launched from Australia, or by  
Australian nationals overseas. For activities approved under the Space (Launches and 
Returns) Act  2018  the Government also accepts liability for damage suffered by 
Australian  nationals, to a maximum value of $3  billion above an insured level.  
To address this risk, in order to have a space or high -power rocket activity approved under 
the Space (Launches and Returns) Act, the responsible party is required to insure against, or 
take financial responsibility for, damage to third parties. The amount of insurance or 
financial responsibility is capped at $100  million.  
The Space (Launches and Returns) Act  provides  for amounts lower than $100  million 
depending on the risk profile of the activity. A maximum probable loss methodology is 
also available to calculate the amount of insurance or financial responsibility.  
Operations and maintenance of the Northern Endeavour and associated 
infrastructure  
On 31 March 2022, Petrofac Facilities Management Limited (Petrofac) was engaged to 
deliver Phase One of the decommissioning of the Northern Endeavour. This will see the 
floating production storage and offtake facility (FPSO) disconnected from the sub -sea 
equipment and temporary suspension of the wells. On 30  September  2022, the operational 
control of the facility transitioned from Upstream Production Solutions Pty Ltd to Petrofac.  
The contract with Petrofac has adopted an industry standard ‘knock -for-knock’ risk and 
liability allocation arrangement, that positions risks so that they are borne by the party 
most likely to be able to financially manage the consequences of a risk materialising. 
Petrofac is liable, to a pre -determined cap, for several insured risks, including to property, 
pollution and the environment. Petrofac will also bear responsibility for some instances of 
loss or damage to the extent it is caused by Petrofac ’s negligence or wilful misconduct.  
The Australian Government has obtained protection and indemnity, facility damage and 
control of well insurance, and taken out membership with oil spill response agencies. These 
limit the Government ’s potential risk and financial exposure.  
The risk of an incident is remote. The floating production storage offtake facility is being 
maintained with safety critical maintenance carried out, limited oil in storage and no 
further oil production taking place. The additional works to prepare for dis connection are 
not considered to materially increase the risk.  
Petrofac Limited, the parent company of Petrofac, is experiencing financial difficulties and 
is pursuing a financial restructure to resolve its solvency issues. So far, delivery of 
Phase  One decommissioning of the Northern Endeavour has remained largely unaffected  | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 232 | Statement 8: Statement of Risks  
by this financial situation, however solvency issues could increase project delivery risks 
and potentially lead to delays and increase costs. The Australian  Government continues to 
work with Petrofac to anticipate and minimise any potential impacts to program delivery.  
The Australian Government has committed to decommission the Northern Endeavour 
FPSO and remediate the Laminaria -Corallina oil fields. The cost to deliver Phase  One of the 
decommissioning, including the disconnection and disposal of the FPSO, is taken into 
account in the forward estimates. However, costs for the subsequent phases of the 
decommissioning – the permanent plug and abandonment of the wells (Phase  Two) and 
the removal of subsea infrastructure (Phase Three), which are estimated to commence over 
the forward estimates period – are not able to be fully quantified until procurement 
activities for those Phases have been completed. Actual costs associated with Northern 
Endeavour decommissioning will be recovered through the Offshore Petroleum (Laminaria 
and Corallina Decommissioning Cost Recovery Levy) Act 2022.  
Contingent liabilities – unquantifiable  
Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation – asbestos 
contamination  
The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) site contains 
asbestos in several buildings and in the soil at the Lucas Heights campus. Although there is 
potential for claims to be made in relation to asbestos -related diseases, the potential costs 
have not been assessed and are unquantifiable contingencies.  
Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation – indemnity  
The Minister for Industry and Science has renewed  a Deed of Indemnity between the 
Australian Government  and ANSTO  under which the Government formally agreed to 
indemnify ANSTO and ANSTO officers  from any loss or liability arising from claims 
caused by ionising radiation. This Deed will remain in place until  March  2035 . 
Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation – legacy waste 
management to final disposal  
ANSTO has accumulated, and will continue to accumulate, radioactive  waste, the final 
disposal of which is unfunded. The majority of this waste has arisen from the production 
of nuclear medicine and will require characterisation in order to determine the nature of, 
and therefore the costs and timing required to manage, the waste to final disposal. It is 
anticipated that the long -term storage of the radioactive waste will be the responsibility of 
the Australian Radioactive Waste  Agency . If this changes, ANSTO may need to meet the 
costs of the future management of the waste.  
Former British atomic test site at Maralinga  
The Australian Government is responsible for 14 unlimited indemnities relating to 
the Maralinga Rehabilitation Project  (1995–2000). In  November  2009, the Australian 
Government agreed to the handback of the former nuclear test site – Maralinga Section  400 
– to the site ’s Traditional Owners, Maralinga Tjarutja. Under the terms of the Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 8: Statement of Risks  | Page 233 
2009  Maralinga Nuclear Test Site Handback Deed, the Australian  Government has indemnified 
the Maralinga  Tjarutja people and the South Australian  Government in respect of claims 
arising from test site contamination.  
Land decontamination and site restoration for CSIRO property  
The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has made a 
financial provision for the estimated costs in restoring and decontaminating land where a 
legal or constructive obligation has arisen. For cases where there is no legal or constructive 
obligation, the potential costs have not been assessed and are unquantifiable contingencies.    | Budget Paper No. 1

Fiscal Risks  
Australia Post ’s financial stability  
Australia Post is a Government Business Enterprise wholly owned by the 
Australian  Government. In the 2023 –24 financial year, Australia Post reported a full 
financial year pre -tax loss of $88.5  million . This is Australia Post ’s second annual loss since 
2014–15. It reflects the way in which digitisation of the global and national economy is 
changing how many people and businesses use postal and related services. Australia  Post 
does not receive financial support from the Australian Government but is required to meet 
a range of Community Service Obligations.  
On 6 December 2023, the Australian Government announced a package of reforms to 
enable Australia Post to boost productivity, increase its focus on parcel delivery services, 
and improve financial sustainability. The Government is monitoring the implementati on of 
these reforms to assess whether they are achieving meaningful financial benefits as 
intended.  
Given the uncertainty surrounding Australia Post ’s financial position, there is a risk that 
the Australian Government will need to consider providing financial assistance to 
Australia  Post in the future.  
Infrastructure Investment Program  project  slippage adjustment  
The Infrastructure Investment Program includes a slippage adjustment to take account of 
historical experience, including the timing of states claiming payments against milestones 
and the complexity of delivery. In the 2025 –26 Budget, t he adjustment is set at $1.7  billion 
in 2024–25, $1.7  billion in 2025 –26, $1.5  billion in 2026 –27 and $0.4  billion in 2027 –28, and is 
unwound over 2028 –29 to 2033 –34.  
As the adjustment does not affect the Australian Government ’s commitments to individual 
states and territories, there is an equivalent financial risk to the Australian  Government 
should the states and territories meet all current project milestones. A similar adjustment 
was implemented in the 2024–25 MYEFO . 
Inland Rail – delivery  
In April  2023, the Australian  Government released the findings of the Independent Review 
of Inland Rail (the Review) and agreed to the 19 recommendations in full or in principle. 
The Review assessed the project ’s scope, schedule and cost. While final project costs will 
not be known until the completion of procurement for all sections of Inland Rail, following 
finalisation of design, planning and gaining environmental approvals, the Review 
identified that the esti mated cost to complete Inland Rail will be significantly higher than 
the available funding.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 8: Statement of Risks  | Page 235 
The Australian  Government will work with independent specialists to review the cost, 
scope, engineering, delivery models and schedule of the project. In the interim, Inland Rail 
Pty Ltd (IRPL) is prioritising the delivery of sections from Beveridge to Park es. 
Significant project delivery risks will remain, including securing jurisdictional support, cost 
and scheduling pressures,  pre-existing land and contamination, and realising revenues.  
Regional Express Holdings Limited (Administrators Appointed) (Rex)  
The Australian  Government has provided a loan of up to $80.0  million to fund the 
operations of Regional Express Holdings Limited (Rex) during the convening period of the 
voluntary administration, until 30  June  2025, and has acquired $50.0  million of debt o wed 
by Rex to become the major secured creditor.  
On 12  February  2025, the Australian  Government announced it would work with the 
Administrators of Rex to support the sale of the business as a going concern, following a 
competitive sales process. The Australian  Government will negotiate with shortlisted 
bidders to support a successful market -led outcome. In the event there is no sale, the 
Government will undertake work on contingency options in consultation with relevant 
states, including preparations necessary for potential Australian  Government acquisition of 
Rex. Further financial support, including to support the competitive sale proces s or in 
potential contingency options, would be subject to a future decision of government.  
Significant but remote contingencies  
Inland Rail – Termination of the Equity Financing Agreement  
The Australian  Government will provide sufficient funding to cover all costs and liabilities 
incurred by the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC) or Inland Rail Pty Ltd for 
delivery of Inland Rail in the event the Commonwealth terminates the Equity Fin ancing 
Agreement between the Commonwealth and the ARTC.  
Maritime Industry Finance Company Limited – Board Members ’ indemnity  
Indemn ities for Maritime Industry Finance Company Limited (MIFCO) board members 
were provided to protect them against civil claims relating to their employment and 
conduct as Directors. MIFCO was placed into voluntary liquidation in  November  2006 and 
was deregis tered on 24  April  2008. The indemnity is not time -limited and continues even 
though the company has been liquidated. Until the indemnity agreements are varied or 
ended, they will remain as contingent and unquantifiable liabilities.  
Moorebank Intermodal Project – Glenfield Waste Site Easement  
The Australian  Government  has provided an indemnity to cover all costs and liabilities that 
may be incurred by the Grantor (the private sector owner of the Glenfield Waste Site) of 
any easement for the rail spur going across the Glenfield Waste Site, to the extent such costs 
or liabilities are caused or contributed to by the Commonwealth or its agents.   | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 236 | Statement 8: Statement of Risks  
National Intermodal Corporation  Limited – Termination of the Funding 
Agreement  
The Australian  Government has provided an indemnity to cover all costs and liabilities that 
may be incurred by the National Intermodal Corporation Limited ( National Intermodal ) if 
the Commonwealth terminates the Funding Agreement between the Commonwealth and 
National Intermodal . 
NBN Co Limited – Termination of the Equity Funding Agreement  
The Australian Government is required to cover all costs and liabilities that may be 
incurred by NBN Co if the Commonwealth terminates the Equity Funding Agreement 
between the Commonwealth and NBN Co.  
Telstra Financial Guarantee  
The Australian Government has provided Telstra Corporation Limited (Telstra) a 
guarantee in respect of NBN Co ’s financial obligations under the Definitive Agreements. 
The Agreements were amended on 14  December  2014. The Guarantee was not amended at 
that time and it continues in force in accordance with its terms in respect of the amended 
Definitive Agreements. The  liabilities under the Definitive Agreements between Telstra and 
NBN Co arise progressively during the roll -out of the National Broadband Network as 
Telstra’s infrastructure is accessed and Telstra ’s customers are disconnected from its copper 
and Hybrid Fibre Coaxial cable networks. The Australian Government is only liable in the 
event NBN Co does not pay an amount when due under the Definitive Agreements. As at 
31 December 2024, NBN Co had liabilities covered by the Guarantee estimated at 
$11.2  billion.  
The Guarantee will terminate when:  
• NBN Co achieves specified credit ratings  for a period of two continuous years  
• the company is capitalised by the Commonwealth to the agreed amount  
• the Communications Minister declares, under the National Broadband Network Companies 
Act 2011 , that, in his or her opinion, the National Broadband Network should be treated 
as built and fully operational. This declaration was made on 11  December  2020.  
Tripartite deeds relating to the sale of federal leased airports  
The tripartite deeds between the Australian Government, the airport lessee company and 
financiers, amend airport (head) leases to provide for limited step -in rights for financiers in 
circumstances where the Australian Government terminates the head lease to enable the 
financiers to correct the circumstances that triggered such a termination event. The 
tripartite deeds may require the Australian Government to  pay financiers compensation as 
a result of terminating the (head) lease, once all Australian  Government costs have been 
recovered. The Australian Government ’s contingent liabilities are considered to be 
unquantifiable and remote.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 8: Statement of Risks  | Page 237 
WSA Co Limited – Board Members ’ indemnities  
The Australian Government has provided an indemnity to the inaugural directors of 
WSA  Co Limited (WSA Co) to protect them against certain claims relating to their role as 
directors. Unless the indemnity agreements are varied or ended, they cease to apply f rom 
the date the Commonwealth has fully satisfied its obligations to subscribe for equity in 
WSA Co pursuant to the WSA Co Equity Subscription Agreement.  
WSA Co Limited – Sydney Metro – Western Sydney Airport indemnity  
The Australian Government has provided an indemnity to cover liabilities that may be 
incurred by WSA Co related to the integration of the Sydney Metro – Western  Sydney 
Airport project (delivered by the New South Wales  Government) with the Western Sydney 
International (Nancy -Bird Walton) Airport, to the extent such liabilities are established in 
the Airport -Rail Integration Deed.  
WSA Co Limited – Termination of the Equity Subscription Agreement  
The Australian Government is required to cover all costs and liabilities that may be 
incurred by WSA Co if the Commonwealth terminates the Equity Subscription Agreement 
between the Commonwealth and WSA  Co. 
Contingent liabilit ies – unquantifiable  
Australian Maritime Safety Authority – ship-sourced pollution incident costs  
In the normal course of operations, shipowners carry the liability for any clean -up costs 
following a ship -sourced marine pollution incident. The Australian Maritime Safety 
Authority (AMSA) is responsible for the provision of interim funds necessary to 
immediately meet clean -up operations and, in all circumstances, seeks to recover these 
costs from ship owners. Where a polluter is not identified, or excess costs cannot be 
recovered from shipowners, AMSA bears the liability.  
AMSA has established a pollution response financial capability to provide funds for 
clean -up expenditure (which may be across a range of concurrent incidents) pending 
recoveries. This is backed by liquid investment reserves of $10 million, and supported by a 
commercial line -of-credit of $40 million.  
The Australian Government meets costs that cannot be recovered and exceeds AMSA ’s 
pollution response financial capability. Given the nature of ship -sourced pollution 
incidents, it is not possible to estimate the amounts of any eventual payments that may be 
required . 
Aviation rescue and firefighting services potential per - and poly -fluoroalkyl 
substances contamination  
The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and 
the Arts (DITRDCA) has identified a number of sites in Australia potentially contaminated  | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 238 | Statement 8: Statement of Risks  
with per - and poly-fluoroalkyl  substances (PFAS), which were contained in firefighting 
foams.  
PFAS contaminants do not naturally break down in the environment and several have been 
listed on the Stockholm Convention as persistent contaminants. Australian health and 
environmental agencies have set a range of standards for environmental protection an d 
precautionary health measures.  
Up to 37 airport sites are potentially contaminated with PFAS (20 federally -leased airports 
and 17 regional airports), which relate to the Australian Government ’s provision of 
firefighting services. DITRDCA is undertaking PFAS investigations at these airports to 
understand the risks and develop management plans for any identified PFAS 
contamination. These investigations are funded under DITRDCA ’s $130.5  million  PFAS 
Airports Investigation Program (the Program). Airservices Australia (Airservices) is 
continuing to implement the National PFAS Management Program, which includes 
ongoing PFAS investigations at 18 airport sites. The costs of potential long -term 
management options cannot be accurately quantified at this time.  
For Commonwealth -owned airports that are leased on a long -term basis, Airport Lessee 
Companies are responsible for environmental management of their airport sites. Airport 
leases indemnify the Commonwealth in relation to damages or injury to the environment, 
including in respect of costs and claims arising due to such damages or injury. However, 
these leases do not indemnify Airservices, as it is a cor porate Commonwealth entity. The 
Commonwealth is not indemnified for 16 airports (which are privately or local government 
owned) in the Program ’s scope because the Commonwealth is not a party to any lease deed 
at these airports. The costs of potential long -term management options cannot be quantified 
at this time.  
A number of Airport Lessee Companies have requested that Airport Environment Officer s 
(AEO s) issue remedial orders to Airservices for PFAS contamination under the Airports 
(Environment Protection) Regulations 1997. Two Environmental Remedial Orders (EROs) 
have been issued to Airservices, directing it to undertake specified remedial work at 
Launceston and Canberra airports, within a set timeframe. AEO s are also actively 
considering regulatory action at Brisbane, Moorabbin and Sydney Airports.  
Brisbane Airport Corporation has commenced legal proceedings in the Queensland 
Supreme Court against Airservices concerning legacy PFAS contamination from 
Airservices ’ use of firefighting foams containing PFAS at the airport. Australia Pacific 
Airports Launceston and Perth Airport Pty Ltd have also commenced legal proceedings 
against Airservices in relation to PFAS contamination in the Federal Court. Potential costs 
relating to these matters are unquantifiable at this time.   
Indemnity provided to the New South Wales Rural Fire Fighting Service in 
relation to the Jervis Bay Territory  
The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and 
the Arts (DITRDCA) engages the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (NSW RFS) to 
provide fire management in the Jervis Bay Territory (JBT). To provide these services, the Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 8: Statement of Risks  | Page 239 
NSW RFS requires the Australian Government to provide an uncapped indemnity against 
any actions or claims resulting from the actions of the NSW RFS while providing fire 
management services in the JBT. The indemnity covers the same period of time for which 
NSW RFS is engaged to provide the fire management services. The likelihood of an event 
occurring that may result in a liability for the Australian Government is assessed as 
unlikely. The risk of a liability is mitigated through a range of risk management m easures, 
including the Jervis Bay Territory Rural Fires Ordinance 2014 , the establishment of a 
JBT Emergency Management Committee (EMC), a fire management plan prepared and 
implemented by the EMC, NSW RFS staff training and professional qualifications and 
DITRDCA actively managing the Service Level Agreement with the NSW RFS . 
Moorebank Intermodal Project – Georges River rail crossing  
The Australian  Government  has provided  an indemnity  to cover  costs  and liabilities  that may  
be incurred  by the State  of New  South  Wales  arising  under  the Native  Title  Act 1993  (Cth)  
associated with the construction of a rail bridge over the Georges River to the Moorebank 
Intermodal Terminal. The likelihood of costs being incurred is considered remote and 
potential costs are unquantifiable.  
Service Delivery Arrangement Indemnities – Indian Ocean Territories and 
Jervis  Bay Territory  
Since  1992, the Australian Government has enter ed into Service Delivery Arrangements 
with the Western Australian (WA) Government for the provision of services to the Indian 
Ocean Territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos  (Keeling)  Islands. The 
Australian  Government  has provided certain indemnities for the WA Government  and its 
respective officers, agents, contractors and employees against civil claims relating to their 
employment and conduct as officers.  
The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Government  provides services to the 
Jervis  Bay Territory under a Memorand um of Understanding. The Australian  Government 
has provided certain indemnities for the ACT Government authorities and officials in 
relation to  the delivery of services to the Jervis Bay Territory.  
The likelihood of an event occurring that may result in a liability for the Australian 
Government  has been assessed as remote and the risks are currently mitigated through the 
training and professional qualifications of the staff of these agencies  and the existence of 
systems, processes and standards for the delivery of services.    | Budget Paper No. 1

National Disability Insurance Scheme  
The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) provides financial support to Australians 
with permanent and significant disability to build capacity, increase independence and 
establish stronger connections with their community.  
As with other demand driven programs, the estimated costs for the Scheme are subject to 
adjustments to reflect observed changes in actual payments. Scheme projections are liable 
to change as significant reform initiatives are implemented and the Scheme con tinues to 
mature. Reform initiatives may lead to revisions to forecasts of the number of Scheme 
participants, the funds allocated in participant support packages, the payments by 
participants from those funds for supports, and the resourcing required by th e National 
Disability Insurance Agency to effectively administer the Scheme.  
National Cabinet committed to a NDIS Financial Sustainability Framework to ensure the 
Scheme is sustainable in the long term, with an annual growth target for Scheme costs of no 
more than 8  per cent from 1  July 2026.  
The National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Getting the NDIS Back on Track No. 1) 
Act 2024  (the amending Act) commenced on 3  October  2024. Changes in the amending Act 
and subsequent amendments to NDIS rules and other legislative instruments will moderate 
growth in Scheme expenditure by determining Scheme participant plan budgets more 
consistent ly based on participant need and supporting participants to spend in accordance 
with their plans.  
The 2025 –26 Budget estimates for the Scheme are based on actual expenditure as at end 
February 2025 and updated projections from the NDIS Actuary.  
Contingent liabilit ies – unquantifiable  
Income apportionment and debt pause  
In November 2020, legislative changes were introduced to simplify income reporting in the 
social security system: income is now reported when it is received, removing the need for 
customers to calculate and report what they have earned each fortnight. This  new approach 
took effect from 7  December  2020. Prior to 7  December  2020, the Australian  Government 
applied a methodology called income apportionment to calculate a customer ’s income 
support entitlement in circumstances when a customer ’s employment income was spread 
across two or more Centrelink fortnightly reporting periods.  
Where income apportionment was or may have been applied to determine certain 
Commonwealth social security debts prior to 7  December  2020, recovery activities have 
been paused, except in particular circumstances. The decision made by the former  | Budget Paper No. 1

Administrative Appeals Tribunal regarding income apportionment ( Secretary, Department of 
Social Services and FTXB ) has been appealed to the Full Federal Court by the respondent.  
Prygodicz v Commonwealth  
In September 2024, Gord on Legal filed an extension application in the Federal Court of 
Australia to appeal settlement orders granted in the Prygodicz  v Commonwealth class 
action on behalf of representative applicants impacted by the Income Compliance Program 
(the Robodebt scheme) . Costs associated with the appeal (if any) and any potential related 
future litigation are not quantifiable until the matter is determined by the Court or 
otherwise resolved.  
Contingent asset – quantifiable  
National Redress Scheme  
The National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Act 2018 supports people 
who experienced institutional child sexual abuse by providing a monetary payment and 
facilitating access to counselling and psychological services and a direct personal response 
from the institution determined to be responsible for the abuse. The Department of Social 
Services (DSS) administers the National Redress Scheme. In this capacity, DSS makes the 
monetary payment to the survivor and then recovers this amount from the responsible 
institution.  
As at  3 February 2025 , DSS has an administered quantifiable contingent asset of  
$578.3  million in relation to the probable recovery from responsible institutions of 
monetary payments that may be made to survivors. The value is based on applications that 
have been referred to an independent decision maker for assessment and average payment 
values.  
As at  3 February 2025 , DSS has an administered quantifiable contingent liability of 
$390.1  million in relation to applications made under the National Redress Scheme that 
have been referred to an independent decision maker for assessment. The amount is based 
on the number of applications and average payment values.  
The difference between the contingent asset and the contingent liability represents the net 
risk to the Budget from the National Redress Scheme.   Budget Paper No. 1  |

Guarantee for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited’s  Pacific 
Liabilities  
The Commonwealth has provided a 10 -year guarantee to Australia and New Zealand 
Banking Group Limited (ANZ ) to secure its long -term commitment to the Pacific. The 
guarantee transfers certain credit risks associated with eligible exposures related to ANZ ’s 
Pacific operations to the Commonwealth. The guarantee can be called on if there is an 
unremedied default by a third party on those exposures held by ANZ. The guarantee will 
support ANZ to maintain and enhance its current retail banking services in the Pa cific, and 
deliver financial literacy and inclusion programs, supporting the ongoing connectivity of 
the Pacific region and Timor -Leste to the Australian and global financial systems.  
Guarantee for the Asian Development Bank ’s Innovative Finance Facility  
The Australian Government has committed to enter into a 25 -year guarantee capped at 
US$200  million (estimated at A$ 321.3  million as at 31 January 2025) with the Asian 
Development Bank (ADB) to support its Innovative Finance Facility for Climate in Asia and 
the Pacific (the  ADB  facility). The ADB facility will support climate mitigation and 
adaptation finance projects of sovereign nations identified by ADB in the Asia and Pacific 
region.  
The guarantee transfers a portion of risk associated with sovereign nations ’ default from 
the ADB facility to the Australian Government. The guarantee will only be called on in the 
event of a sovereign nation defaulting on a project under the  ADB  facility.

associated with a $320  million New South Wales (NSW) Government loan to the Asbestos 
Injuries Compensation Fund (AICF), contingent on all states and territories agreeing to 
assume the remaining default risk. States and territories agreed to assume the remaining 
default risk foll owing the publication of the 2016 –17 Budget.  
The AICF provides compensation to Australian asbestos disease related claims against 
former subsidiaries of the James Hardie Group and is funded on an ongoing basis through 
contributions from the James Hardie Group. NSW provided a $320  million loan facilit y in 
2010 to enable AICF to continue to pay compensation as lump sums, rather than in 
instalment s.  | Budget Paper No. 1

Financial Claims Scheme  
The Financial Claims Scheme provides depositors of authorised deposit -taking institutions 
(ADIs) and claimants against general insurers with timely access to their funds in the event 
of a financial institution failure.  
Under the Banking Act 1959 , the Financial Claims Scheme  provides a mechanism for 
making payments to depositors under the Australian Government ’s guarantee of deposits 
in ADIs. Payments are capped at $250,000 per account holder per ADI. The total value of 
deposits eligible for coverage under the Financial Claims Scheme was estimated at 
$1.3 trillion as at 30 June 2024 .  
Under the  Insurance Act 1973 , the Financial Claims Scheme provides a mechanism for 
making payments to eligible beneficiaries with a valid claim against a failed general 
insurer. It is not possible to estimate the amounts of any eventual payments that may be 
required in relation to general insurance claims.  
In the very unlikely event of an ADI or general insurer failure, any payments made under 
the Financial Claims Scheme would be recovered through the liquidation of the failed 
institution. If there was a shortfall in the amount recovered through the liquidat ion of the 
failed institution, a levy could be applied to the relevant industry to recover the difference 
between the amount expended and the amount recovered in the liquidation.  
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is responsible for the 
administration of the Financial Claims Scheme. Under the Financial Claims Scheme, any 
payments to account holders with eligible protected  accounts or eligible claimants would 
be made from APRA ’s Financial Claims Scheme Special Account. Under the legislation, 
upon declaration by the Minister in relation to a specified ADI, up to $20  billion per 
institution would be available to meet Financial Claims Scheme payments and up to 
$100  million per inst itution for administration costs.  
Guarantee  for Housing Australia  
The Australian  Government guarantees the due payment of money payable by Housing 
Australia to anyone other than the Government.  
The Housing Australia Board must not allow Housing Australia to enter into a transaction 
that would result in its total guaranteed liabilities, and any outstanding amount borrowed 
from the Government, to exceed $26  billion, unless approved by the Governmen t. 
Guarantees under the Commonwealth Bank Sale Act 1995  
Under the Commonwealth Bank Sale Act 1995 , the Australian Government guarantees 
various superannuation and other liabilities of the Commonwealth Bank  of Australia . As at 
31 December  2024, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia holds no attributed liabilities and 
$4.3 billion is attributable to liabilities of the Commonwealth Bank Officers ’ 
Superannuation.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 8: Statement of Risks  | Page 245 
Reserve Bank of Australia – Guarantee  
The Australian Government guarantees the liabilities of the Reserve Bank of Australia 
(RBA), measured as the RBA’s  total liabilities excluding capital, reserves, and 
Australian  Government deposits. The principal component of the RBA ’s liabilities consists 
of exchange settlement balances. As at 31 January  2025, exchange settlement balances 
amount to $2 60.2 billion, and the total guarantee is $3 78.2 billion.  
Contingent liabilities – unquantifiable  
Establishment of a cyclone and related flooding reinsurance pool  
The Government provides an annually reinstated Government guarantee to the Australian 
Reinsurance Pool Corporation (ARPC) of $10  billion, or a larger amount if required, to 
support a reinsurance pool for the impact of cyclones and related flooding on eligi ble 
insured properties. The guarantee took effect from 1  July 2022, following the passage of 
legislation in  March  2022, and may be called upon in the event of a large cyclone and 
related flooding, or in a year with a high number of cyclones and related flo oding, to 
ensure the ARPC can pay all liabilities.  
The reinsurance pool is designed to be cost neutral to Government over time, based on the 
predicted cost and frequency of cyclone events. The estimated value and range of calls on 
the guarantee is unquantifiable due to significant uncertainty in the freque ncy and severity 
of cyclones and the resulting losses.  
Guarantees for housing  
The Australian Government has several programs to support individuals to enter the 
housing market sooner. These are administered by Housing Australia.  
The First Home Guarantee  (formerly the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme) is designed to 
support eligible first home buyers, and non -first home buyers who have not owned a 
property in Australia within the past ten years, to build or purchase a home by providing a 
guarantee to participating lenders for up to 15  per cent of the property purchase price. 
The First Home Guarantee began on 1  January  2020.  
The New Home Guarantee  is designed to support eligible first home buyers seeking to 
build a new home or purchase a newly built home by providing a guarantee to 
participating lenders for up to 15 per cent of the property purchase price. A second tranche 
of 10,000  New Home Guarantees was made available from 1  July 2021. The New Home 
Guarantee concluded on 30  June  2022 but guarantees issued in previous financial years 
remain active.  
The Family Home Guarantee  is designed to support single parents and single legal 
guardians with dependents seeking to enter, or re -enter, the housing market. The Family 
Home Guarantee commenced on 1  July 2021.   | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 246 | Statement 8: Statement of Risks  
The Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee  is designed to support eligible first home 
buyers and non -first home buyers who have not owned a property in Australia within the 
past ten years, to build or purchase a home in a regional location by providing a guarantee 
to participating lenders of up to 15  per cent of the property purchase price (subject to a 
minimum deposit of 5  per cent). The Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee commenced on 
1 October  2022.  
For the four programs listed above, the Australian Government guarantees the liabilities as 
they arise. Guaranteed liabilities arise where a lender ’s loss is covered by the guarantee. 
The lender then makes a claim against the guarantee and Housing Australia assesses the 
claim. Given liabilities under the Scheme are met by a standing appropriation, Housing 
Australia is not required to maintain capital and reserves to meet the liabilities associated 
with these programs.  
Indemnities for specialised external advisers during the COVID -19 pandemic  
The Government has provided indemnities for certain specialised external advisers 
engaged to provide advice on emerging markets issues related to  COVID -19. Indemnities 
were provided to mitigate personal risk and provide coverage for costs related to any legal 
proceedings that may arise in relation to the provision of that advice.  
The indemnities apply for the period of engagement as advisers and for claims that are 
notified within 12  years after cessation of the adviser ’s engagement. Until the indemnity 
agreements are varied or expire, they will remain as contingent and unquantifiable 
liabilities.  
Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Guarantee Scheme and SME Recovery 
Loan  Scheme  
The Australian Government provided support for small and medium enterprises during 
the COVID -19 pandemic through guaranteeing loans issued by participating lenders. 
This  support was provided under a number of schemes.  
The Coronavirus Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) Guarantee Scheme  provided a 
guarantee of 50  per cent of the eligible loan amount for eligible small and medium 
enterprises  and the Show Starter Loan Scheme  provided a guarantee of 100  per cent of the 
eligible loan amount for the arts and entertainment businesses, with both schemes closing 
for new loans on 30  June  2021.  
The SME Recovery Loan Scheme , an expansion and extension of the Coronavirus SME 
Guarantee Scheme, provided a guarantee of up to 80  per cent of the eligible loan amount, 
and was initially available to applicants from 1  April  2021 until 31  December  2021.  
The SME Recovery Loan Scheme was extended from 1  January  2022 to 30  June  2022, and 
during this period the Government provided a guarantee of 50  per cent of the eligible 
loan  amount.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 8: Statement of Risks  | Page 247 
Under each of the above schemes, the Australian  Government guaranteed to pay an 
approved lender in the event of default by small and medium enterprises. Although all 
schemes have closed to new loans, the risk to the Australian  Government remains until the 
final claim date for SME Recovery Loan Scheme on 30  September  2033.  
Terrorism insurance – commercial cover  
The Terrorism and Cyclone Insurance Act 2003  (formerly the Terrorism Act 2003 ) established 
a scheme for terrorism insurance covering damage to commercial property, including 
associated business interruption and public liability (extended in  2017 to mixed -use and 
high -value residential buildings). The  Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation (ARPC) 
uses reinsurance premiums paid by insurers to meet its administrative expenses, to 
maintain a pool of funds and to purchase reinsurance to help meet future claims. 
The Australian  Government guarantees to pay any liabilities of the ARPC, however the 
responsible Minister (or delegate) must declare a reduced payout rate to insured entities if 
the Government ’s liability would otherwise exceed $10  billion.  
Contingent liabilities – quantifiable  
Australian Taxation Office – tax disputes  
The Australian Taxation Office is  regularly  involved in a range of dispute resolution 
processes, including litigation, relating to tax disputes.  
Details of the outcome of dispute resolution processes remain uncertain until a court ruling 
is made and/or an agreement is reached with the taxpayer. Accordingly, in most cases it is 
not possible to reliably estimate the likely financial impact of current  disputes. The 
estimated aggregate value of tax in dispute as at 30  September  2024, for which a provision 
has not been made, is $ 12.5 billion.  
Outcomes of dispute resolution processes are included in the Commissioner of Taxation ’s 
Annual Report each year. This may include disputes resolved through objections, 
settlements and court and tribunal decisions. It may also include amounts owed by 
taxpayers that are subject to dispute but not finalised.  
International financial  institutions – uncalled capital subscriptions  
The Australian Government has held an uncalled capital subscription in the International 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) since 1947. As at 31 January 2025, 
Australia ’s uncalled capital subscription to the IBRD was around US$4.4  billion 
(approximately A$ 7.0 billion).  
The Australian Government has  held  an uncalled capital subscription in the European Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) since 1991. As at 31 January 2025, Australia ’s 
uncalled capital subscription to the EBRD was around EUR237.5  million (approximately 
A$396.4 million).   | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 248 | Statement 8: Statement of Risks  
The Australian Government has held an uncalled capital subscription in the Asian 
Development Bank (ADB) since 1966. As at 31 January 2025, Australia ’s uncalled capital 
subscription to the ADB was around US$7.0  billion (approximately A$ 11.3 billion).  
The Australian Government has held an uncalled capital subscription in the Multilateral 
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)  since 1999 . As at 31 January 2025, Australia ’s 
uncalled capital subscription to the MIGA was around US$26.5  million  (approximately 
A$42.5 million ).  
The Australian Government has held an uncalled capital subscription in the Asian 
Infrastructure Investment Bank  (AIIB) since  2015. As at 31 January 2025, Australia ’s 
uncalled capital subscription to the AIIB was around US$3.0  billion (approximately 
A$4. 7 billion ). 
International Monetary Fund – 16th General Review of Quota  
The Australian Government has consented  to a 50  per cent increase to its International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) quota. Under the agreement, Australia ’s quota will increase from 
Special  Drawing Rights (SDR)  6.6 billion  (approximately A$13. 8 billion  as at 
31 January  2025 ) to SDR  9.9 billion  (approximately A$ 20.7 billion as at 31 January 2025) . 
This increase maintains Australia ’s voting power at the IMF and share of any future SDR 
allocation, and increases access to fund financing.  
The timing of the implementation of the quota increase and the accompanying required  
contribution is uncertain; and is subject to conditions including consent by members 
representing 85  per cent of the existing quota. 25 per cent of the increase, SDR  821.6  million 
(approximately A$1. 7 billion as at 31 January 2025) , will be made in foreign currency (in 
consultation with the IMF) and the remainder will be covered by Australian dollar 
denominated promissory notes. If the IMF quota increase is implemented it w ill be largely 
offset by reductions in Australia ’s other IMF commitments.  
International Monetary Fund – New Arrangements to Borrow & Bilateral 
Borrowing  Agreement  
Australia has made a line of credit available to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
under its New Arrangements to Borrow since 1998. This is a contingent loan to help ensure 
that the IMF has the resources available to maintain stability in the global ec onomy.  
On 26 January 2020, the IMF Executive Board approved amendments to the New 
Arrangements to Borrow decision, including increasing the credit arrangements of all 
participants and extending the arrangement from 1 January 2021 to 31  December  2025. On 
8 October 2020, the Australian Government advised the IMF that Australia consented to 
this decision. On 19 July 2024, a renewal of the New Arrangements to Borrow was adopted 
by a decision of the IMF ’s Executive Board. The Government is undertaking the relevant 
proc ess under the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947  to enable Australia to carry 
out its obligations. As at 31 January 2025 , the value of Australia ’s New Arrangements to 
Borrow credit arrangement is around Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 4.4  billion 
(approximately A$ 9.3 billion). If the IMF quota increase is implemented, the value of Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 8: Statement of Risks  | Page 249 
Australia ’s contribution will decrease by SDR 0.7 billion to SDR 3.7 billion (approximately 
A$7. 8 billion as at 31 January  2025 ).  
Australia has also made available approximately SDR 2.0 billion (approximately 
A$4.2 billion as at 31 January 2025 ) through a contingent bilateral loan to the IMF, known 
as a Bilateral Borrowing Agreement (the Agreement). This contingent bilateral loan is on 
terms consistent with other bilateral loans and note purchase agreements between the IMF 
and other contributing  countries. The contingent bilateral loan will be drawn upon by the 
IMF only if needed to supplement the IMF ’s quota and New Arrangements to Borrow 
resources, and any drawings on loans would be repaid in full, with interest. On 
26 July 2023, Australia agreed to extend the Agreement by one year through to 
31 December 2024. On 20  November 2024, the Australian Government finalised a further 
extension of the Agreement through to 31  December 2027.  If the IMF quota increase is 
implemented before 31  December 2027, Australia ’s Agreement will be allowed to expire.  
International Monetary Fund  – Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust  
The Australian Government has entered into agreements to make a line of credit available 
to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust 
through to 31  December  2029. The Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust provides 
concessional financial support to low -income countries to help them achieve, maintain, or 
restore a stable and sustainable macroeconomic position. Poverty Reduction and Growth 
Trust funds are drawn upon by the IMF as needed and will be repaid in full, with int erest.  
Through these agreements, the Government has made available Special Drawing Rights 
(SDR) 1  billion  (approximately A$2. 1 billion as at 31 January 2025 ) to loan to the IMF under 
the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust . As at 30 June 202 5, it is estimated SDR 
270.8 million  (approximately A$550.8 million as at 31 January 2025)  will have  been drawn 
down, leaving SDR 7 29.2 million (approximately A$1.5  billion as at 31 January  2025 ) 
available to the IMF under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust . 
International  Monetary Fund  – Resilience and Sustainability Trust  
On 11 October 2022, the Australian Government entered into an agreement to make a line 
of credit of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 760  million (approximately A$ 1.6 billion as at 
31 January 2025 ) available to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF) under the Resilience 
and Sustainability Trust through to 30  November 2030. The Resilience and Sustainability 
Trust will provide affordable long -term financing to help vulnerable countries build 
resilience and sustainability to address risks stemming from climate chang e and pandemic 
preparedness. Resilience and Sustainability Trust line of credit funds are drawn upon by 
the IMF as needed and will be repaid in full, with interest. As at 30 June 202 5, SDR 
74.9 million  (approximately A$152.3  million as at 31 January 2015)  is expected to have  been 
drawn down, leaving SDR  685.1 million (approximately A$1. 4 billion as at 31 January 2025 ) 
available to the IMF under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust.

Veterans ’ Affairs  
Fiscal Risk  
Defence Service Homes Insurance  Scheme  
The Defence Service Homes Insurance Scheme (DSH Insurance) was established in  1919 
under  the Defence Service Homes Act  1918 . DSH Insurance  offers  home building insurance  
products to eligible serving Australian Defence Force members, veterans and widow(er)s.  
DSH Insurance is funded by premiums collected from policy holders and returns on 
investments. Due to the nature of insurance, DSH Insurance ’s financial performance can be 
volatile from year to year. The last few  years have been challenging for  DSH Insurance due 
to increases in claims from extreme weather events (including bushfires, hailstorms and 
floods), and increased pricing on reinsurance premiums. These are industry -wide 
challenges affecting all general  insurers.  
DSH Insurance manages the volatility of the insurance cycle by aiming for an appropriate 
level of capital (that is, reserves) consistent with the regulations placed on insurers and 
monitored by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. DSH Insurance also has a 
comprehensive reinsurance program in place, reducing the exposure to loss by passing part 
of the risk of loss to a group of reinsurers. Nevertheless, there remains a risk that additional 
Government contributions could be required should these re serves be insufficient to cover 
the liabilities of DSH Insurance.   Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 8: Statement of Risks  | Page 251 
Government  loans  
Loans are recorded as financial assets. Accordingly, the amounts advanced and repaid do 
not normally affect the Budget aggregates of fiscal balance and underlying cash balance. 
Loans that are concessional (lower than market interest rate) or are agreed to be written off, 
result in an impact on the fiscal balance.  
The Government makes loans for policy purposes. All loans contain some element of credit 
risk that they will not be repaid in full, although in many cases this risk is small. Table  8.3 
summarises Government loans estimated to exceed $200  million  at 30 June  2025 .

Drought -related and farm finance concessional loans – Agriculture  
As at 30  June  2025 , the fair value of farm business, drought and dairy farm related loans is 
estimated to total  $152.0  million.  
Drought Recovery and Dairy Recovery Concessional Loans Scheme:  The drought 
recovery component of this scheme provided loans to farm businesses affected by 
unprecedented drought or, where applicable, Queensland farm businesses directly 
impacted by the combined effects of drought and the mid -2011 disruption to live cattle 
exports to Indonesia. The loans funded planting and restocking activities and associated 
expenses when seasonal conditions allowed. The loans were available from January  2015 
and, in 2014 –15, operated in Queensland and New South Wales. In 2015 –16, drought 
recovery concessional loans were available in Queensland, New South Wales, 
South  Australia and Tasmania.  
The dairy recovery component of this scheme provided concessional loans to dairy farm 
businesses affected by the 2016 reduction in farm gate milk prices by Murray Goulburn, 
Fonterra and National Dairy Products. Loans were available for debt restructuring, 
providing new debt for operating expenses or productivity enhancement activities, or a 
combination of these purposes. Dairy recovery concessional loans became available in 
Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Tas mania from June 2016. Applications 
closed on 31 October 2016. A dairy recovery concessional loan product was available  under 
the Farm Business Concessional Loans Scheme until 30  June  2018.  
As at 1 February  2025, the scheme ’s interest rate was 4.23  per cent. The interest rate is 
reviewed on a six -monthly basis and revised in accordance with changes in the ten -year 
Australian  Government bond rate. Loans have a maximum term of ten years with 
interest -only payments required for the first five years. Principal and interest repayments 
will be made in the remaining five years of the loan term.  
Farm Business Concessional Loans Scheme: This scheme provided three types of 
concessional loans: drought assistance, dairy recovery and business improvement. This 
scheme was designed to cover a farmer ’s short -term needs when income was tight and to 
supplement, rather than replace, commercial finance. Loans under the scheme were first 
available in November 2016. Applications for loans under the scheme closed on 
30 June  2018.  
Drought assistance concessional loans were available in Queensland, New South Wales, 
Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. Loans were available for 
debt restructuring, operating expenses, drought preparedness activities or drought  
recovery activities or a combination of these purposes.  
Business improvement concessional loans were available in Queensland, New South Wales, 
Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. Loans were available for 
eligible Farm Household Allowance (FHA) recipients who were recovering from fina ncial

Clean Energy Finance Corporation  
The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) has developed a portfolio of loans and 
investments across the spectrum of clean energy technologies, as required by the Clean 
Energy Finance Corporation Act 2012 and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Investment 
Mandate Direction 2023  (the Investment Mandate), comprising the General Portfolio, 
Rewiring the Nation Fund and Specialised Investment Funds.  
The CEFC ’s loan portfolio consists of predominantly senior -ranking secured loans and 
secured project finance facilities, typically secured against energy generating assets such as 
wind or solar farms or energy efficiency assets.  
The CEFC ’s Rewiring the Nation Fund is delivering  concessional finance, including loans, 
for projects that support grid transformation. This portfolio of predominantly concessional 
loans is expected to be comprised mainly of unsecured corporate facilities, senior ranking 
secured loans and secured project  finance facilities.  
The CEFC ’s Specialised Investment Funds portfolio of loans (consisting of the Clean Energy 
Innovation Fund, the Advancing Hydrogen Fund, the Powering Australia Technology 
Fund and the Household Energy Upgrades Fund) are expected to be predominantly 
unsecured corpor ate facilities, senior -ranking secured loans, bonds and secured project 
finance facilities.  
The targeted level of risk for each of these portfolios is set out in the Investment Mandate. 
For all but the Rewiring the Nation Fund, the CEFC Board seeks to develop a portfolio of 
loans and investments that, in aggregate, has an acceptable but not exces sive level of risk 
relative to the sector and the specific focus of each of the Funds. For the Rewiring the 
Nation Fund, the Board must seek to develop a portfolio that, in aggregate, has an 
acceptable level of risk relative to the sector and the focus of the Rewiring the Nation Fund.  
The Rewiring the Nation Fund investments may increase the CEFC ’s overall exposure to 
risk as the scale, concentration, loan tenor and nature of these investments will have a 
higher risk profile. The Specialised Investment Funds may also have a higher risk profile 
than the General Portfolio, however they are a relative ly smaller component of the CEFC ’s 
overall exposure.  
The CEFC has predominantly made loans as a co -financier either jointly or in consortiums 
with private sector financial institutions. Interest rates vary with a current average expected 
return of approximately 4. 7 per cent. Loans have various maturity dates, typically in the 
range of 5 to 15 years, although it is anticipated that  average  loan tenors will be extend ed 
under the Rewiring the Nation Fund. As at 30 June  2025, loans contracted and outstanding 
(excluding bonds and equities) are estimated to total  $4.6 billion .

National Reconstruction  Fund Corporation  
The National Reconstruction Fund Corporation Act 2023  (NRFC Act) commenced on 
18 September  2023 , establishing the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation (NRFC) to 
facilitate increased flows of finance into priority areas of the Australian economy . 
The NRFC offers loans and guarantees and makes equity investments in priority areas of 
the economy consistent with the NRFC  Act and the associated instrument. The NRFC will 
make a range of investments, including in emerging technologies and technically complex 
projects that carry higher risk. There are also risks inherent in investing in a large and 
diverse portfolio of financial assets. In practice, this will involve some short -term volatility 
in the NRFC ’s returns, including the possibility of credit loss es across the portfolio.  
While the NRFC has been  established in 2023 –24, the risk around revenue and loss 
projections are unquantifiable at this time.   
The NRFC Board develops the NRFC ’s investment portfolio with an appropriate risk 
tolerance relative to the National Reconstruction Fund priority areas as required by the 
National Reconstruction Fund Corporation (Investment Mandate) Direction 2023  and the 
National  Reconstruction Fund Corporation (Priority Areas) Declaration  2023.

Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Loans  
The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) is a financing  facility established by 
the Australian Government under the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Act  2016  and 
will continue to make investment decisions until 30  June  2026. The primary purpose of the 
NAIF is to provide loans or alternative financing mechanisms to infrastructure projects. 
The infrastructure that NAIF can finance is wide ranging and includes assets that facilitate 
the establishment or enhancement of busin ess activity o r increase economic activity in a 
region.  
To be eligible for a loan from the NAIF, including up to 100  per cent of the project ’s debt, 
project proponents must meet the mandatory criteria outlined in the NAIF Investment 
Mandate that commenced on 15 December 2023. Since its establishment, the NAIF has been 
amended to:  
• expand the eligibility for NAIF financing to include non -construction activities 
associated with the development of economic infrastructure  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 8: Statement of Risks  | Page 261 
• provide NAIF with an expanded debt offering , including the ability to provide letters of 
credit, guarantees and lend in foreign currency, finance smaller loans through working 
with financing partnerships, and in certain circumstances provide financing directly to 
proponents rather than via the Stat es or Northern Territory  
• make equity investments subject to a cap of $50  million  and a minimum of $5  million  
per investment, for non -controlling interest  
• enhance the potential to deliver significant public benefit to northern Australia by 
allowing NAIF to assume financial risk in a project that is acceptable but not excessive, 
and removing the prohibition against the Australian Government assuming the 
majority risk in any project.  
• legislate the requirement to earmark $500  million  of its $7  billion  appropriation to go 
towards realising the Government ’s Critical Minerals Strategy and create alignment of 
investment decisions to Government Policy Priorities  
• add further areas to be considered as part of NAIF ’s Risk Appetite Statement – 
including risk sharing between NAIF and the Australian Government, climate change 
related risks and net zero transition risks  
• extend NAIF ’s internal and external reporting on investments  
• further tighten NAIF ’s Direct Financing powers and a greater emphasis on 
consulting/collaborating with other Commonwealth entities/Specialist Investment 
Vehicles.  
The Australian  Government updated the Investment Mandate to give effect to these 
changes.

Australian Government Budget 
Financial  Statements   
Consistent with the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 (the Charter),  the Government has 
produced a set of financial statements for the Australian Government general government 
sector (GGS), the public non -financial corporations (PNFC) sector, the total non -financial 
public sector (NFPS) and the public financial corporations (PFC) sector. The financial 
statements comply with both the Australian Bureau of Statistics ’ (ABS) accrual Government 
Finance Statistics (GFS) and Australian Accounting Standards (AAS), with departures 
disclosed. These statements are:  
• an operating statement, including other economic flows, which shows net operating 
balance and net lending/borrowing (fiscal balance)  
• a balance sheet, which shows net worth, net financial worth, net financial liabilities 
and net debt  
• a cash flow statement, which includes the calculation of the underlying cash balance.  
In addition to these general purpose statements, notes to the financial statements are 
required. These notes include a summary of accounting policies, disaggregated information 
and other disclosures required by AAS.  
The statements reflect the Government ’s policy that the ABS GFS remains the basis of 
budget accounting policy, except where AAS is applied because it provides a better 
conceptual basis for presenting information of relevance to users of public sector 
financial  reports.  
The Australian, state and territory governments have an agreed framework – the Uniform 
Presentation Framework (UPF) – for the presentation of government financial information 
on a basis broadly consistent with the Australian Accounting Standard AASB  1049. 
The financial statements are consistent with the requirements of the UPF.

Notes to the general government sector financial statements  
Note  1: External reporting standards and accounting policies  
The Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998  (the Charter) requires that the Budget be based on 
external reporting standards and that departures from applicable external reporting 
standards be identified.  
The external standards used for budget reporting purposes are:  
• the Australian Bureau of Statistics ’ (ABS) accrual Government Finance Statistics (GFS) 
publication, Australian System of Government Finance Statistics: Concepts, Sources and 
Methods, 2015  (cat. no. 5514.0), which is based on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
accrual GFS framework  
• the Australian Accounting Standards (AAS), issued by the Australian Accounting 
Standards Board (AASB), which includes International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted in Australia for use by the not -for-profit sector and specific standards such as 
AASB  1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting  
(AASB  1049).  
The financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis that complies with both 
the ABS GFS and AAS, except for departures disclosed at Note  2. A more detailed 
description of the AAS and the ABS GFS frameworks, in addition to definitions of key 
terms used in these frameworks, can be found in Appendix A. Detailed accounting policies, 
as well as a set of notes and other disclosures as required by  AAS, are disclosed in the 
Australian Government Consolidated Financial Statements.  
Fiscal reporting focuses on the general government sector (GGS). The GGS provides public 
services that are mainly non -market in nature and for the collective consumption of the 
community, or involve the transfer or redistribution of income. These services are largely 
financed through taxes and other compulsory levies. This sector comprises all government 
departments, offi ces and some other bodies. In preparing financial statements for the GGS, 
all material transactions and balances between entities within t he GGS have been 
eliminated.  
The Government ’s key fiscal aggregates are based on the ABS GFS concepts and 
definitions, including the ABS GFS cash surplus/deficit and net financial worth. 
AASB  1049 requires the disclosure of other ABS GFS fiscal aggregates, including the net 
operating balance, net lending/borrowing (fiscal balance) and net worth. In addition to 
these ABS GFS aggregates, the Uniform Presentation Framework (UPF) requires disclosur e 
of net debt, net financial worth and net financial liabilities.  
AASB  1049 and the UPF also provide a basis for reporting the public non -financial 
corporations (PNFC) and public financial corporations (PFC) sectors and the total 
non-financial public sector (NFPS).  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  | Page 287 
AASB  1049 requires disaggregated information, by ABS GFS function, for expenses and 
total assets to be disclosed where they are reliably attributable. The ABS GFS does not 
require total assets to be attributed to functions. In accordance with the ABS GFS, 
disag gregated information for expenses and net acquisition of non -financial assets by 
function is disclosed in Statement 5: Expenses and Net Capital Investment.  In accordance with 
the UPF, purchases of non -financial assets by function are also disclosed in  Statement 5. 
AASB  1055 Budgetary Reporting  requires major variances between original budget estimates 
and outcomes to be explained in the financial statements. Explanations of variances in fiscal 
balance, revenue, expenses, net capital investment, cash flows, net debt, net financial worth 
and net worth since the 202 4–25 Budget are disclosed in the Statement 3: Fiscal Strategy and 
Outlook , with decisions taken since the  2024–25 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 
(MYEFO) disclosed in Budget Paper No. 2 Budget Measures 2 025–26. All policy decisions 
taken between the 202 4–25 Budget and the 202 4–25 MYEFO are disclosed in Appendix A of 
MYEFO.  
Details of the Australian Government ’s GGS contingent liabilities are disclosed in 
Statement  8: Statement  of Risks.  
Note  2: Departures from external reporting standards  
The Charter requires that departures from applicable external reporting standards be 
identified. The major differences between AAS and the ABS GFS treatments of transactions 
are outlined in Table  9.13. 
AASB  1049 requires AAS measurement of items to be disclosed on the face of the financial 
statements with reconciliation to the ABS GFS measurement of key fiscal aggregates, where 
different, in notes to the financial statements. Only one measure of each aggregat e has been 
included on the face statements to avoid confusion.  
Further information on the differences between the two systems is provided in the ABS 
publication  Australian System of Government Finance Statistics: Concepts, Sources and Methods, 
2015  (cat. no. 5514.0).

Table  9.13: Major differences between AAS and ABS GFS  
Issue  AAS treatment  ABS GFS treatment  Treatment 
adopted  
Circulating coins – 
seigniorage  The profit between the cost 
and sale of circulating coins 
(seigniorage) is treated as 
revenue.  Circulating coins is treated as 
a liability, and the cost of 
producing the coins is treated 
as an expense.  AAS 
Valuation of loans  Changes in the valuation of 
loans are treated as a revenue 
or an expense.  
In some circumstances 
recognition as a revenue or an 
expense is delayed until the 
loan ends or is transferred.  Changes in the valuation of 
loans (excluding mutually 
agreed write -downs) are 
treated as an ‘other 
economic  flow’. ABS GFS  
Timing recognition 
of Boosting Cash 
Flow for Employers  Expense recognition is based 
on underlying economic 
activity that gives rise to the 
Cash Flow Boost payment.  Recognised when the 
businesses receive payments 
after submitting their activity 
statements and having met all 
requirements.  AAS 
Leases  AASB  16 introduced a single 
lease accounting framework 
for lessees, which replaced the 
distinction between operating 
and finance leases. Right of 
use assets and lease liabilities 
are recognised on the balance 
sheets for leases that were 
previously accounted for  as 
operating expense.  The distinction between 
operating leases and finance 
leases is continued for 
lessees.  AAS 
Concessional loans  Concessional elements are 
treated as an expense on initial 
recognition and unwound over 
the loan term.  Concessional elements are 
treated as an ‘other economic 
flow’. AAS 
Investment in other 
public sector 
entities  Valued at fair value in the 
balance sheet as long as it can 
be reliably measured, 
otherwise net assets is 
permissible.  Unlisted entities are valued 
based on their net assets in 
the balance sheet.  AAS 
Provision for 
restoration, 
decommissioning 
and make -good  Capitalised when the asset is 
acquired.  Capitalised when make -good 
activity takes place.  AAS 
Renewable Energy 
Certificates (RECs)  The issuance and registration 
of RECs is considered to be an 
administrative function and 
does not result in the 
recognition of assets or 
liabilities and, consequently, no 
revenue or expenses are 
recognised.  The issuance and registration 
of RECs is considered to be 
government financial 
transactions resulting in the 
recognition of assets, liabilities, 
revenue and expenses.  AAS 
Dividends paid by 
public corporations  Treated as an equity 
distribution. Equity distributions 
are treated as a distribution of 
profits, as opposed to an 
expense.  Dividends are treated as 
an expense.  ABS GFS  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  | Page 289 
Table  9.13: Major differences between AAS and ABS GFS (continued)  
Issue  AAS treatment  ABS GFS treatment  Treatment 
adopted  
Dividends paid by 
the Reserve Bank 
of Australia  Dividends are recognised in 
the year profit was earned.  Dividends are recognised 
when the Treasurer makes a 
determination.  AAS 
National Disability 
Insurance Scheme 
(NDIS) revenue  Funding contributions by the 
state and territory governments 
to NDIS are treated as sales of 
goods and services revenue.  
In-kind disability services 
provided by the state and 
territory governments are 
treated as other revenue.  Funding contributions by the 
state and territory governments 
to NDIS are treated as grants 
revenue.  
In-kind disability services 
provided by the state and 
territory governments are 
treated as sales of goods and 
services revenue.  AAS 
Commercial tax 
effect accounting 
assets and 
liabilities  Corporations in the PNFC and 
PFC sectors record tax 
expenses on a commercial 
basis.  Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are reversed so that 
corporations record tax 
expenses on a consistent 
basis to the Australian 
Taxation Office.  ABS GFS  
Timing recognition 
of vaccine expense  Recognised when vaccines are 
delivered to the states and 
territories.  Recognised when the vaccine 
doses are administered. 
Vaccine wastage after 
distributions are recognised as 
an ‘other economic flow ’. AAS 
Regional 
Broadband 
Scheme  The revenue from the levy on 
internet service providers 
(ISPs) and the associated 
subsidy expense to NBN Co 
for the provision of regional 
broadband services are 
recorded separately on a gross 
basis.  The revenue from the levy on 
ISPs and the associated 
subsidy expense to NBN Co 
are recorded on a net basis.  AAS 
Fiscal aggregates differences  
Net worth of PNFC 
and PFC sectors  Calculated as assets less 
liabilities.  Calculated as assets less 
liabilities less shares and other 
contributed capital.  AAS 
Net financial worth 
of PNFC and PFC 
sectors  Calculated as financial assets 
less total liabilities.  Calculated as financial assets 
less total liabilities less shares 
and contributed capital.  AAS 
Classification differences  
Prepayments  Treated as a non -financial 
asset.  Treated as a financial asset.  ABS GFS

a) For budget reporting purposes, a discount rate of 5.0  per cent determined by actuaries in preparing the 
2023 Long Term Cost Reports is used to value the superannuation liability. This reflects the average 
annual rate estimated to apply over the term of the liability and it reduces the volatility in reported 
liabilities that would occur from year to year if the s pot rates on long -term government bonds were used. 
Consistent with AAS, the superannuation liability for the 2023–24 Final Budget Outcome (FBO) was 
calculated using the spot rates on long -term government bonds as at 30 June 202 4 that best matched 
each individual scheme ’s liability duration. These rates were between 4. 2 and 4. 8 per cent per  annum.

Appendix A: Financial reporting standards 
and budget concepts  
The Budget primarily focuses on the financial performance and position of the general 
government sector (GGS). The GGS provides public services that are mainly non -market in 
nature and for the collective consumption of the community, or involve the transfer or 
redistribution of income. These services are largely financed through taxes and other 
compulsory levies. AASB  1049 recognises the GGS as a reporting entity.  
AASB  1049 Conceptual framework  
AASB  1049 seeks to ‘harmonise ’ the ABS GFS and AAS.  
The reporting framework for AASB  1049 requires the preparation of accrual -based general 
purpose financial reports, showing government assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and 
cash flows. GGS reporting under AASB  1049 aims to provide users with information about 
the stewardship of each government in relation to its GGS and accountability for the 
resources entrusted to it; information about the financial position, performance and cash 
flows of each government ’s GGS; and information that facilitates assessme nts of the 
macroeconomic impact. AASB  1049 also provides a basis for whole -of-government 
reporting, including for the PNFC and PFC sectors.  
AASB  1049 has adopted the AAS conceptual framework and principles for the recognition 
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and their presentation, measurement and 
disclosure. In addition, AASB  1049 has broadly adopted the ABS GFS conceptual 
framework for presenting government financial statements. In particular, AASB  1049 
requires the GGS to prepare a separate set of financial statements, overriding AASB  10 
Consolidated Financial Statements . AASB  1049 also follows the ABS GFS by requiring changes 
in net worth to be split into either transactions or ‘other economic flows ’ and for this to be 
presented in a single operating statement. AASB  1049 is therefore broadly consistent with 
international statistical standards and the International Monetary Fund ’s (IMF) Government 
Finance Statistics Manual 2014 .3

Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  | Page 303 
All financial data presented in the financial statements are recorded as either stocks 
(assets  and liabilities) or flows (classified as either transactions or ‘other economic flows ’). 
Transactions result from a mutually agreed interaction between economic entities. 
Despite  their compulsory nature, taxes are transactions deemed to occur by mutual 
agreement between the government and the taxpayer. Transactions that increase or 
decrease  net worth (assets less liabilities) are reported as revenues and expenses 
respectively in the operating statement.4 
A change to the value or volume of an asset or liability that does not result from a 
transaction is an ‘other economic flow ’. This can include changes in values from market 
prices, most actuarial valuations and exchange rates, and changes in volumes from 
discoveries, depletion and destruction. All ‘other economic flows ’ are reported in the 
operating statement.  
Consistent with the ABS GFS framework, and in general AAS, the financial statements 
record flows in the period in which they occur. As a result, prior period outcomes may be 
revised for classification changes relating to information that could reasonably h ave been 
expected to be known in the past, is material in at least one of the affected periods and can 
be reliably assigned to the relevant period(s).  
Operating statement  
The operating statement presents details of transactions in revenues, expenses, the net 
acquisition of non -financial assets (net capital investment) and other economic flows for an 
accounting period.  
Revenues arise from transactions that increase net worth and expenses arise from 
transactions that decrease net worth. Revenues less expenses gives the net operating 
balance. The net operating balance is similar to the National Accounts concept of 
governme nt saving plus capital transfers.  
The net acquisition of non -financial assets (net capital investment) equals gross fixed capital 
formation, less depreciation, plus changes (investment) in inventories, plus other 
transactions in non -financial assets.  
‘Other economic flows ’ are presented in the operating statement and outline changes in net 
worth that are driven by economic flows other than revenues and expenses. Revenues, 
expenses and ‘other economic flows ’ sum to the total change in net worth during a period. 
The majority of ‘other economic flows ’ for the Australian  Government  GGS arise from price 
movements in its assets and liabilities.  
— 
4 Not all transactions impact net worth. For example, transactions in financial assets and 
liabilities do not impact net worth as they represent the swapping of assets and liabilities 
on the balance sheet.   
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 304 | Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  
Net operating balance  
The net operating balance is the excess of revenue from transactions over expenses from 
transactions. The net operating balance excludes expenditure on the acquisition of capital 
assets but includes non -cash costs such as accruing superannuation entitlements and the 
consumption of capital (depreciation). By including all accruing costs, including 
depreciation, the net operating balance encompasses the full current cost of providing 
government services. Th is makes it a measure of the sustainability of the go vernment ’s 
fiscal position over time and provides an indication of the sustainability of the existing level 
of government services.  
Fiscal balance  
The fiscal balance (or net lending/borrowing) is the net operating balance less net capital 
investment. The fiscal balance includes the impact of net expenditure (effectively purchases 
less sales) on non -financial assets rather than consumption (depreciation) of non -financial 
assets.5 
The fiscal balance measures the Australian Government ’s investment -saving balance. 
It measures in accrual terms the gap between government savings plus net capital transfers 
and investment in non -financial assets. As such, it approximates the contribution of the 
Australian Government GGS to the balance on the current account in the balance of 
payments.  
Balance sheet  
The balance sheet shows stocks of assets, liabilities and net worth. In accordance with the 
UPF, net debt, net financial worth and net financial liabilities are also reported in the 
balance sheet.  
Net worth  
The net worth of the GGS, PNFC and PFC sectors is defined as assets less liabilities. 
This  differs from the ABS GFS definition for the PNFC and PFC sectors where net worth is 
defined as assets less liabilities less shares and other contributed capital. Net  worth is an 
economic measure of wealth, reflecting the Australian Government ’s contribution to the 
wealth of Australia.   
— 
5  The net operating  balance includes consumption of non -financial assets because depreciation 
is an expense. Depreciation  is deducted in the calculation  of net capital investment as the full 
investment in non -financial assets is included in the calculation of fiscal balance.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  | Page 305 
Net financial worth  
Net financial worth measures a government ’s net holdings of financial assets. It is 
calculated from the balance sheet as financial assets minus liabilities. This differs from the 
ABS GFS definition of net financial worth for the PNFC and PFC sectors, defined as 
financial assets, less liabilities, less shares and other contributed capital. Net financial worth 
is a broader measure than net debt, in that it incorporates provisions made (such as 
superannuation) as well as equity holdings. Net financial worth in cludes all classes of 
financial assets and all liabilities, only some of which are included in net debt. 
As non-financial assets are excluded from net financial worth, this is a narrower measure 
than net worth. However, it avoids the concerns inherent with the net worth measure 
relating to the valuation of non -financial assets and their availability to offset liabilities.  
Net financial liabilities  
Net financial liabilities comprises total liabilities less financial assets but excludes equity 
investments in the other sectors of the jurisdiction. Net financial liabilities is a more 
accurate indicator than net debt of a jurisdiction ’s fiscal position as it includes substantial 
non-debt liabilities such as accrued superannuation and long service leave entitlements. 
Excluding the net worth of other sectors of government results in a purer measure of 
financial worth than net financial worth as, in general,  the net worth of other sectors of 
government, in particular the PNFC sector, is backed by physical assets.  
Net debt  
Net debt is the sum of interest bearing liabilities less the sum of selected financial assets 
(cash and deposits, advances paid and investments, loans and placements). Financial assets 
include the Future Fund ’s investments in interest bearing securities and collective 
investment vehicles (CIVs). CIVs enable investors to pool their money and invest the 
pooled funds, rather than buying securities directly.  Net debt does not include 
superannuation related liabilities. Net debt is a common measure of the streng th of a 
government ’s financial position. High levels of net debt impose a call on future revenue 
flows to service that debt.  
The 2015 ABS GFS Manual presents debt in a matrix format, with no single net debt 
aggregate identified. The Australian Government continues to report net debt in 
accordance with the UPF as described above.    
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 306 | Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  
Cash flow statement  
The cash flow statement identifies how cash is generated and applied in a single accounting 
period. The cash flow statement reflects a cash basis of recording (rather than an accrual 
basis) where information is derived indirectly from underlying accrual tr ansactions and 
movements in balances. This, in effect, means that transactions are captured when cash is 
received or when cash payments are made. Cash transactions are specifically identified 
because cash management is considered an integral function of ac crual budgeting.  
Underlying cash balance  
The underlying cash balance is the cash counterpart of the fiscal balance, reflecting the 
Australian Government ’s cash investment -saving balance.  
For the GGS, the underlying cash balance is calculated as shown below:  
Net cash flows from operating activities  
plus 
Net cash flows from investments in non -financial assets  
equals  
ABS GFS cash surplus/deficit  
plus 
Principal payments of lease liabilities  
equals  
Underlying cash balance  
Under the Future Fund Act 2006,  earnings are required to be reinvested to meet the 
Government ’s future public sector superannuation liabilities.  The Government excluded 
net Future Fund cash earnings from the calculation of the underlying cash balance between 
2005–06 and 2019 –20. From 2020 –21 onwards, net Future Fund cash earnings have been 
included in the calculation of the underlying cash balance because the Future  Fund became 
available to meet the Government ’s superannuation liabilities from this year.  
In contrast, net Future Fund earnings have been included in the net operating balance and 
fiscal balance for all years because superannuation expenses relating to future cash 
payments are recorded in the net operating balance and fiscal balance.  
Net Future Fund earnings are separately identified in the historical tables in Statement  10: 
Historical Australian Government Data.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  | Page 307 
Headline cash balance  
The headline cash balance is calculated by adding net cash flows from investments in 
financial assets for policy purposes to the underlying cash balance.  
Net cash flows from investments in financial assets for policy purposes include equity 
transactions and advances paid. Equity transactions include equity injections into 
controlled businesses and privatisations of government businesses. Advances paid inclu de 
net loans to the states and net loans to students.  
Sectoral classifications  
To assist in analysing the public sector, data are presented by institutional sector as shown 
in Figure  A.9.1. The ABS GFS defines the GGS, PNFC and PFC sectors. AASB  1049 has also 
adopted this sectoral reporting.

Future Fund  
The Future Fund was established in 2006 to accumulate financial assets and invest them on 
behalf of the Australian Government to address the Government’s unfunded 
superannuation liability. The Government provides guidance to the Future Fund Board of 
Guardians (the Future Fund Board) in relation to its investment strategy through the 
issuance of an investment  mandate. The Board is independently responsible for the 
investment decisions of the Future Fund . 
The investment mandate for the Future Fund sets a benchmark rate of return of at least CPI 
plus 4.0 to 5.0  per cent per annum over the long -term. It requires the Future Fund Board to Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  | Page 315 
have regard to national priorities in performing its investment functions. National priorities 
comprise: supporting an energy transition as part of the net zero transformation of the 
Australian economy, increasing the supply of residential housing in Australia, and 
delivering improved infrastructure located in Australia . The investment mandate also 
requires the Board to take an acceptable, but not excessive, level of risk, measured in terms 
such as the probability of losses in a particular year .  
Between establishment and 31  December 2024, the average return has been 7.8  per cent 
per annum against the benchmark return of 6.9 per cent. For the 12 -month period ending 
31 December 2024, the Future Fund return was 1 2.2 per cent against a benchmark return of 
6.4 per cent. The Future Fund was valued at $237.9 billion as at 31  December  2024 .

DisabilityCare Australia Fund  
The DisabilityCare Australia Fund (DCAF) was established on 1  July 2014 to assist the 
Commonwealth and the state and territory governments with spending directly related to 
the National Disability Insurance Scheme.  
The DCAF is funded by revenue raised from the 0.5  per cent increase in the Medicare levy 
to 2.0  per cent, set in 2014 –15. As at 31  December 2024, the DCAF had received credits 
totalling $ 45.3 billion. Since inception to 31  December 2024, $2 8.7 billion has been paid from 
the DCAF.  
The investments of the DCAF are managed by the Future Fund Board. The Investment 
Mandate for the DCAF provides guidance to the Future Fund Board in relation to its 
investment strategy for the DCAF. The DCAF Investment Mandate sets a benchmark return 
of the  Australian 3 -month bank bill swap rate plus 0.3  per cent per annum calculated on a 
rolling 12 -month basis (net of fees). In achieving its objectives, the Board must invest in a 
way that minimise s the probability of capital losses over a 12 -month horizon.   
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 316 | Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  
For the 12 -month period ending 31  December 2024, the DCAF return was 5. 2 per cent 
against the benchmark return of 4. 8 per cent. The DCAF was valued at $1 9.6 billion as at 
31 December 2024.  
Medical Research Future Fund  
The Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) was established on 26 August 2015 to provide 
additional funding for medical research and medical innovation.  
The investments of the MRFF are managed by the Future Fund Board. The Investment 
Mandate for the MRFF provides broad direction to the Future Fund Board in relation to its 
investment strategy. The MRFF Investment Mandate sets a benchmark return of the 
Reser ve Bank of Australia ’s Cash Rate target plus 1.5 to 2.0  per cent per annum, net of 
costs, over a rolling 10 -year term.  
Since inception to 31 December  2024, MRFF investments have returned 4. 9 per cent 
per annum against a benchmark return of 3. 3 per cent. For the 12 -month period ending  
31 December  2024, the MRFF’s return was 9.1 per cent against the benchmark return of 
5.9 per cent. The MRFF was valued at $23. 9 billion as at 31 December  2024.  
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund  
The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund (ATSILSFF) was 
established on 1 February 2019 to support payments to the Indigenous Land and Sea 
Corporation.  
The ATSILSFF was seeded with the capital of the former Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander Land Account (Land Account) – approximately $2.0  billion. The Land Account 
was abolished on the establishment of the ATSILSFF.  
The investments of the ATSILSFF are managed by the Future Fund Board. The Investment 
Mandate for the ATSILSFF provides broad direction to the Future Fund Board in relation to 
its investment strategy. The ATSILSFF Investment Mandate sets a long -term benchmark 
return of CPI plus 2.0 to 3.0  per cent per annum, net of costs.  
Since inception to 31  December 2024, ATSILSFF investments have returned 5. 8 per cent 
per annum against a benchmark return of 5. 7 per cent. For the 12 -month period ending 
31 December  2024, the ATSILSFF returned 10.3 per cent against a benchmark return of 
4.4 per cent. The ATSILSFF was valued at $2. 3 billion as at 31  December 2024.  
Future Drought Fund  
The Future Drought Fund (FDF) was established on 1 September 2019 to fund initiatives 
that enhance future drought resilience, preparedness and response across Australia.  
The FDF provides disbursements of $100.0  million  per annum, with the first disbursement 
made in July 2020.   Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  | Page 317 
The investments of the FDF are managed by the Future Fund Board. The Investment  
Mandate for the FDF provides broad direction to the Future Fund Board in relation to its 
investment strategy. The FDF Investment Mandate sets a long -term benchmark return of 
CPI plus 2.0  to 3.0  per cent per annum, net of costs.  
Since inception to 31 December 2024, FDF investments have returned 7.5 per cent 
per annum against a benchmark return of 5.8 per cent. For the 12-month  period ending 
31 December 2024, the FDF returned 10.3  per cent against the benchmark return of 
4.4 per cent. The FDF was valued at $ 5.1 billion as at 31 December 2024.  
Disaster Ready Fund  
The Disaster Ready Fund (DRF) was initially established as the Emergency Response Fund 
(ERF) on 12  December  2019 and provided up to $150  million  per year for emergency 
response and recovery, and up to $50  million  per year for natural disaster resilience an d 
risk reduction.  
On 1  March  2023, legislative changes took effect that renamed the ERF as the DRF and 
allowed up to $200  million  per annum to be drawn from the DRF to fund natural disaster 
resilience and risk reduction from 2023 –24 onwards.  
The investments of the DRF are managed by the Future Fund Board. The Investment 
Mandate for the DRF provides broad direction to the Future Fund Board in relation to its 
investment strategy. The DRF Investment Mandate sets a long -term benchmark return of 
CPI plus 2.0  to 3.0  per cent per annum, net of costs.  
Since inception to 31 December  2024, DRF investments have returned 7. 5 per cent 
per annum against a benchmark return of 5.8 per cent. For the 12-month  period ending  
31 December  2024, the DRF returned 10.3 per cent against the benchmark return of  
4.4 per cent. The DRF was valued at $4. 9 billion as at 31 December 2024.  
Housing Australia Future Fund  
The Housing Australia Future Fund (HAFF) was established on 1 November 2023 and 
credited with $10.0 billion. The HAFF is an investment vehicle dedicated to supporting and 
increasing social and affordable housing, as well as supporting other acute housing n eeds 
such as Indigenous communities and housing services for women, children and veterans.  
The investments of the HAFF are managed by the Future Fund Board. The Investment 
Mandate for the HAFF provides broad direction to the Future Fund Board in relation to its 
investment strategy. The HAFF Investment Mandate sets a long -term benchmark return of 
CPI plus 2.0  to 3.0  per cent per annum, net of costs.  
Since inception to 31  December 2024, HAFF investments have returned 7.5 per cent 
per annum against a benchmark return of 3.7  per cent. The  HAFF was valued at 
$10.9 billion as at 31  December 2024.

Specialist investment vehicles  
Specialist investment vehicles make investments in projects, businesses and joint ventures 
to deliver  Australian Government policy objectives. Each specialist investment vehicle has 
discrete policy objectives  and uses a specific set of financial instruments to achieve them, 
including  concessional loans, debt issuances and equity investments.  
Specialist investment vehicle s are usually corporate Commonwealth entities (CCEs) 
established by enabling legislation that define the entity’s functions and the roles and 
responsibilities of the independent board as the accountable authority. The only exception 
is the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific , which is part of the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ( a non-corporate Commonwealth entity ).   
The Australian Government has eight specialist investment vehicle s: 
Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific   
The Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP) commenced on 
1 July 2019 and  provides  grants, loans and guarantees  to sovereign, state owned enterprise 
and private sector partners  for infrastructure investments in Pacific  island countries 
and Timor -Leste .  
The objective  of AIFFP  is to advance Australia’s national interest by  contributing to a 
stable, secure and prosperous Pacific.  AIFFP prioritises projects that assist countries to 
respond and adapt to climate change risks and impacts, as part of the Government’s Pacific 
Climate Infrastructure Financing Partnership.  
As at 30 June 2024, AIFFP administer ed $1 billion in grants of which $480  million had been 
committed to projects. AIFFP also provides up to $3  billion in loans and guarantees issued 
by Export Finance Australia  on its behalf via the National Interest Account.  
Australian Renewable Energy Agency   
Established as a CCE by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency Act 2011 , the Australian 
Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA ) provides grant funding to support research, 
development and early commercialisation for renewable energy technology projects.  
ARENA invests in priority sectors including ultra low -cost solar, renewable electricity, 
renewable hydrogen, low -emissions metals, low -emissions transport, low -carbon liquid 
fuels and clean energy manufacturing.   Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  | Page 319 
As it provides grants ARENA does not generate a return on funds invested, however, some 
projects include contingent recoupment rights. Grants are determined by an independent 
board based on maximum impact and value.  
As at 30 June 2024, ARENA was responsible for administering $8.5  billion in grants.  
Clean Energy Finance Corporation  
The Clean Energy Finance Corporation ( CEFC ) was established as a CCE by the  Clean 
Energy Finance Corporation Act 2012  (CEFC  Act). The CEFC Act defines complying 
investments as including:  
• clean energy technologies: energy efficiency, low -emission and renewable energy 
technologies  
• solely or mainly Australian based: determined by the Board and consistent with the 
investment mandate  
• not in prohibited technology; carbon capture and storage, nuclear technology and 
nuclear power.  
The CEFC performs its investment functions in accordance with the Clean Energy Finance 
Corporation Investment Mandate Direction 2023 . The investment mandate broadly requires 
the CEFC to facilitate increased flows of finance into t he clean energy sector and to facilitate 
the achievement of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction target . The investment 
mandate also sets out four funds ( the General Portfolio, the Rewiring the Nation Fund, the 
Specialised Investment Fund and General Portfolio investments ), benchmark rates of return 
for each, portfolio risk and limits on concessionality.  
As at 30 June 2024, CEFC had $31.9  billion made available to it for investment, of which 
$10.9  billion had been committed to projects.  
Export Finance Australia  
Export Finance Australia (EFA) was established as a CCE by the Export Finance and 
Insurance Corporation Act 1991 . EFA is the Australian Government’s export credit agency 
and supports Australian export trade and overseas infrastructure development that  
benefits Australia, through loans, bonds, guarantees, insurance and equity investments.  
EFA is a self -funding entity and operates on a commercial basis, charging customers fees 
and premiums as well as earning interest on loans  and investments.  
EFA provides financial support to exporters on one of two accounts : the Commercial 
Account , where  EFA carries  all risks and los ses, and retains all  margins and fees ; and the 
National Interest Account, where the  responsible Minister  can direct EFA to  support 
transactions that  are in the national interest.  
As at 30 June 2024, EFA had $8.6  billion in committed funding, including the loans 
administered on behalf of AIFFP.

Page 320 | Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  
Housing Australia  
Established as a CCE by the Housing Australia Act 2018  (Housing Australia Act), Housing 
Australia improves social and affordable housing outcomes for Australians through loans 
and grants, guarantees and capacity development for community housing providers , and 
delivering programs to help more Australians access social and affordable housing. 
Housing Australia performs its investment functions in accordance with its investment 
mandate.  
The investment mandate for Housing Australia outlines the activities and allocation of 
funds for the Affordable Housing Bond Aggregator (AHBA), the National Housing 
Infrastructure Facility (NHIF), the Housing Australia Future Fund Facility, the National 
Housing Accord Facility and the Home Guarantee Scheme. For the AHBA, Housing 
Australia must target an average return that covers the operating costs of the AHBA and 
allows it to build an adequate capital reserve. For the NHIF it must target a rate of return 
that allows it to maintain a the value of funds allocated to it plus the Commonwealth cost 
of capital.        
As at 30 June 2024, Housing Australia had $6.8  billion available for investment of which 
$3.8 billion had been committed to projects. This does not include investments of the HAFF , 
which is administered by the Future  Fund and was valued at $10. 9 billion as at 
31 December 2024 . 
National Reconstruction Fund Corporation  
The National Reconstruction Fund Corporation ( NRFC ) was established as a CCE  by the 
National Reconstruction Fund Corporation Act 2023 . The NRFC makes investment decisions to 
support, diversify and transform Australia's industry and  economy, help to create secure, 
well -paid jobs, secur e future  prosperity, and driv e sustainable economic growth. The NRFC  
provides debt, equity and guarantees to facilitate increased flows of finance into the 
following  priority areas of the Australian economy  identified in regulation:  renewables and 
low emission  technologies , value -add in agriculture, forestry and fisheries , transport , 
medical science , renewables and low emission technologies , defence capability , and  
enabling capabilities.  
The NRFC must target an average return of between 2 and 3  per cent above the five -year 
Australian government bond rate .  
As at 30 June 2024, NRFC had $15.0  billion available to it by 2029 for investment . 
Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility  
The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) was established as a CCE by the 
Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Act 2016  to provide finance to businesses and 
infrastructure projects for the development of Northern Australia’s economy. NAIF's area 
of operation includes all of the Northern Territory and those parts of Queensland and 
Western Australia above or directly below o r intersecting with the Tropic of Capricorn. Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  | Page 321 
NAIF’s projects stimulate economic growth by attracting private investment and fostering 
infrastructure development.  
The NAIF is required to make investments to support one or more of five Government 
policy priorities, including : sustainable and resilient economic development and the 
alleviation of economic or social disadvantage ; key infrastructure projects ; sustainability, 
climate change and circular economy principle s; realising the Critical Minerals Strategy ; 
and materially improving the lives of Indigenous people and communities.  
When providing financial assistance, which is primarily through loans, the NAIF must be 
satisfied that the return is likely to cover at least its administrative costs and the 
Commonwealth’s cost of borrowing. For equity or equity -like investments the NAIF must 
target a return of at least the five -year Australian Government bond rate plus a premium of 
3 per cent per annum.  
As at 30 June 2024, NAIF had $7.0  billion made available to it for investment of which 
$3.6 billion had been committed to projects.  
Regional Investment Corporation  
Established as a CCE by the Regional Investment Corporation Act 2018 , the Regional 
Investment Corporation (RIC) administer s concessional  loans for farm businesses . These 
loans  support the resilience and  sustainability of Australia’s agricultural economy, with a 
focus on  assisting eligible farm businesses and farm -related businesses to  remain 
prosperous and grow.    
RIC loans  can be used to prepare for, manage through, and  recover from severe financial 
disruption outside of a farmer’s  control such as drought, natural disasters, biosecurity and 
market  issues.  RIC loans can also be used to help new and next generation f armers set up 
farms and keep farms in the family through succession planning.  The majority of  RIC loans 
provide up to 5 years interest -only and a 10 -year loan term, allowing borrowers  to generate 
positive cashflows before repayment of principal. The RIC se ts the variable interest rates on 
its loan products with reference to the average Australian Government 10 -year bond rate 
plus a margin.  
As at 30 June 2024, RIC had $3.8  billion made available to it for investments of which 
$3.1 billion had been provided as loans to customers.  
Equity investments  
Equity investments is comprised of three  components:  
• investments in those Government Business Enterprises that are public non -financial 
corporations including NBN Co, Snowy Hydro Limited and the Australian Rail Track 
Corporation.  
• investments in other public sector entities outside the General Government Sector , 
including certain components of specialist investment vehicles such as Export Finance  
 | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
 
Page 322 | Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  
Australia and Housing Australia, and investments held by specialist investment 
vehicles  inside the General Government Sector , such as the Clean Energy Finance 
Corporation and the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation.  
• investments held in relation to the Australian Government Investment Funds, such as 
shares, which are expected to increase steadily over the forward estimates due to 
additional contributions from Government and expected investment returns over time.  
Government Business Enterprises  
Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) represent a significant proportion of equity 
investments held by the Australian Government.  
These are  commercially focused  government owned businesses that are established to fulfil 
an Australian Government purpose. They make a substantial contribution to the Australian 
economy by supporting productivity, job creation and Government policy objectives.  
Further information on the financial performance of individual GBEs is included in the 
annual report for each entity, including details of equity contributed by the Australian 
Government. GBE valuations are updated annually in accordance with Australian 
Accounting Standards and reported by the relevant portfolio department in its annual 
report.  
Non-financial assets  
The Government ’s non -financial assets are estimated to be $2 20.6 billion at 30 June 202 5, 
increasing to $25 7.3 billion by 30 June 202 9.  
Non -financial assets comprise assets such as land, buildings and property, plant and 
equipment and right -of-use lease assets. Non -financial assets are expected to grow 
consistently over the forward estimates predominantly due to increased investments in 
Specialised Military Equipment .  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  | Page 323 
Liabilities  
The Government ’s total liabilities were $1. 4 trillion at 30 June 202 4, and are expected to 
increase to around $1. 8 trillion by 30 June 202 9.  
The composition of Australian Government General Government Sector  liabilities at 
30 June 202 5 is presented below in Chart 9.B.4. 
Chart 9.B.4: Australian government liabilities composition  
 
 
The Government ’s major liabilities are Australian Government securities on issue (see

Note:  Other interest bearing liabilities includes deposits held, loans and lease liabilities. Other provisions 
and payables includes  other employee liabilities, suppliers payable, personal benefits payable, 
subsidies payable, grants payable, other payables and provisions.  
 
Total liabilities are expected to grow consistently over the forward estimates, which is 
predominantly due to growth in government securities on issue and  superannuation  
liabilities.  
Government securities  
Government securities on the Australian Government ’s balance sheet reflect the market 
value of the Australian Government securities on issue, consistent with external reporting 
standards. Further detail on the face value of Australian Government securities can be 
found in Statement 6: Debt Statement .  
Public sector employee superannuation liabilities  
Public sector employee superannuation entitlements relating to past and present civilian 
employees and military personnel are a financial liability on the Government ’s balance 
sheet. Total superannuation liabilities are projected to be $303.3 billion at 30  June  2025, 
$340.6 billion  at 30 June 202 9 and approximately $50 5.9 billion at 30 June 2060.  Budget Paper No. 1  |  
 
Statement 9: Australian Government Budget Financial Statements  | Page 325 
These liabilities represent the present value of future unfunded superannuation benefits 
relating to past and present employees and are based on an actuarially determined 
discount rate. The long -term nature of the unfunded superannuation liabilities requires the 
use of a discount rate that best matches the duration of the liabilities. The use of a long -term 
discount rate for budget purposes avoids the volatility that would occur by using current 
market yields on Government bonds. The value recorded on the b alance sheet is highly 
sensitive to the discount rate used.  
In preparing the latest Long Term Cost Reports for the civilian and military schemes, the 
scheme actuaries determined that a discount rate of 5.0  per cent should be applied.  
The Australian Government has never fully funded its defined benefit scheme 
superannuation liabilities. However, the Future Fund was established in 2006 to help 
finance the Government ’s unfunded superannuation liabilities.  
For civilian employees, the major defined benefit schemes are the Commonwealth 
Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme. These schemes 
were closed to new members in 1990 and 2005 respectively. The Public Sector 
Superannuation Accum ulation Plan was introduced on 1 July 2005 and provides fully 
funded accumulation benefits for new civilian employees from that date.  
For military personnel, the defined benefit schemes are the Defence Force Retirement and 
Death Benefits Scheme, the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Scheme and the Military 
Superannuation and Benefits Scheme (MSBS). Following the closure of the MSBS on 
30 June  2016, all defined benefit military schemes are now closed to new members. A new 
military superannuation accumulation scheme, Australian Defence Force (ADF) Super, 
commenced on 1  July 2016. ADF Super is accompanied by a statutory death and disability  
arrangement ADF cover.  
While there have not been any new members to the public service and military defined 
benefit schemes since closure in 2005 and 2016 respectively, the Government ’s unfunded 
superannuation liabilities are expected to grow as current members continue to accrue 
benefits prior to retirement. Consistent with the 202 3 Long  Term Cost Reports, the 
unfunded liability for public service defined benefit schemes is projected to peak in the 
mid-2030 ’s, whilst the unfunded liability for military defined benefit schemes is  projected 
to continue to increase over time to 2060. The present value of the superannuation liability 
is also sensitive to changes in the discount  rate.  
As the superannuation liabilities are included in the Government ’s net worth and 
net financial worth aggregates, revaluations of the liabilities have an impact on 
these  aggregates.

Statement 10: Historical Australian Government Data  | Page 331 Statement 10 : Historical Australian 
Government Data  
This statement  reports historical data for the Australian Government fiscal aggregates 
across the general government, public non -financial corporations and non -financial 
public  sectors.  
Data sources  
Data has been  sourced from Australian Government Final Budget Outcomes , the 
Australian  Bureau of Statistics (ABS), the Australian Office of Financial Management 
and Australian  Government Consolidated  Financial Statements . 
• Accrual data from  1996–97 onwards and cash data, net debt data, net financial 
worth  data and net worth data from  1999–2000 onwards are sourced from 
Australian  Government Final Budget Outcomes . Back -casting adjustments for accounting  
classification changes and other revisions have been made from 1998 –99 onwards 
where  applicable.  
• Cash data prior to 1999 –2000 are sourced from ABS data, which have been 
calculated  using methodology consistent with that used for later years in 
ABS  cat. no. 5512.0  Government Finance Statistics . 
• Net debt data prior to  1999–2000 are from ABS  cat. no. 5512.0 Government Finance 
Statistics  2003–04 in 1998–99, ABS  cat. no. 5501.0 Government Financial Estimates    
1999–2000  and ABS  cat. no. 5513.0 Public Sector Financial Assets and Liabilities  1998 
from  1987–88 to 1997–98, and Treasury estimates (see Treasury ’s Economic Roundup, 
Spring  1996,  pages 97 –103) prior to  1987–88. 
Comparability of data across years  
The data set contains a number of structural breaks owing to accounting classification 
differences and changes to the structure of the budget which cannot be eliminated through 
back -casting because of data limitations. These breaks can affect the comparability of data 
across years, especially when the analysis is taken over a large number of years. Specific 
factors causing structural breaks include:  
• Classification differences in the data relating to the period prior to  1976–77 mean that 
earlier data may not be entirely consistent with data for  1976–77 onwards.  
• Most recent accounting classification changes that require revisions to the historical 
series have been back -cast (where applicable) to  1998–99, ensuring that data are 
consistent across the accrual period from  1998–99 onwards. However, because of 
data  limitations, these changes have not been back -cast to earlier years.   | Budget Paper No. 1  
 
Page 332 | Statement 10: Historical Australian Government Data  
• Cash data up to and including  1997–98 are calculated under a cash accounting 
framework, while cash data from  1998–99 onwards are derived from an accrual 
accounting framework. 0F6 Although the major methodological differences associated 
with  the move to the accrual framework have been eliminated through back -casting, 
comparisons across the break may still be affected by changes to some data sources and 
collection methodologies.  
• Adjustments in the coverage of agencies are included in the accounts of the different 
sectors. These include the reclassification of Central Banking Authorities from the 
general government to the public financial corporations sector in  1998–99, and 
subsequ ent back -casting to account for this change.  
• Prior to  1999–2000, Australian Government general government sector debt instruments 
are valued at historic cost, whereas from  1999–2000 onwards they are valued at market 
prices (consistent with accrual GFS standards). This affects net debt and net interes t 
payments.  
• Changes have been made in arrangements for transfer payments, where tax concessions 
or rebates are replaced by payments through the social security system. This has the 
effect of increasing both cash receipts and payments, as compared with earlier periods,  
but not changing cash balances. Changes in the opposite direction reduce both cash 
payments and receipts.  
• From  2005–06 onwards, underlying Government Finance Statistics (GFS) data are 
provided by agencies in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards (AAS), 
which include International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted in 
Australia. Prior to  2005–06, underlying GFS data are based on data provided by 
agencies applying AAS prior to the adoption of IFRS.  
• From  2019–20 onwards, as a result of the implementation of the accounting standard 
AASB  16 Leases , the distinction between operating and finance leases for lessees has 
been removed. This change impacted a number of budget aggregates, in particular 
net debt and net financial worth. Due to data limitations, these changes have not been 
back -cast to earlier years.  
  
— 
6 Prior to the 2008 –09 Budget, cash data calculated under the cash accounting framework were 
used up to and including  1998–99. In the 2008 –09 Budget, cash data prior to  1998–99 have 
been replaced by ABS data derived from the accrual framework.   
Statement 10: Historical Australian Government Data  | Page 333 Revisions to previously published data  
Under the accrual GFS framework and generally under AAS, flows are recorded in the 
period in which they occurred. As a result, prior period outcomes may be revised for 
classification changes relating to information that could reasonably have been expected to 
be known in the past, is material in at least one of the affected periods, and can be reliably 
assigned to the relevant period(s). This includes revisions to the historical estimates of 
nominal GDP to align with the ABS cat. no. 5206.0 Australian Nation al Accounts  which can 
have minor impacts on data published as a per cent of GDP.  
There have been no material classification changes that have resulted in back casting in 
this update.

The Government will extend by a further two years, to 24  October  2027, a measure 
imposing additional tariffs on goods that are the produce or manufacture of Russia or 
Belarus.  
The measure continues to deny Russia and Belarus access to the most favoured nation 
status through the application of an additional 35 per  cent tariff on goods that are the 
produce or manufacture of Russia or Belarus and had not left for direct shipment to  
Australia from a place of manufacture or warehouse before 25  April  2022.  
This temporary measure is a response to Russia ’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, supported by 
Belarus, and is necessary for the protection of Australia ’s essential security interests.  
This measure is estimated to result in a negligible increase in receipts over five  years from 
2024–25.

The Government will amend the tax laws to clarify arrangements for managed investment 
trusts, to ensure legitimate investors can continue to access concessional withholding tax 
rates in Australia complementing the A ustralian Taxation Office’s strengthened guidelines 
to prevent misuse. This measure will apply to fund payments from 13  March  2025.  
The Government will also defer the start dates of the following measures:  
• The 2023 –24 Budget measure Extending the clean building managed investment trust 
withholding tax concession  from 1  July 2025 to the first 1  January, 1  April, 1  July or 
1 October after the Act receives Royal Assent.  
• The 2024 –25 Budget measure Strengthening the foreign resident capital gains tax regime 
from 1  July 2025 to the later of 1  October  2025 or the first 1  January, 1  April, 1  July or 
1 October after the Act receives Royal Assent.  
Deferring the start date of the amendments to the foreign resident capital gains tax regime 
is estimated to decrease receipts by $50.0  million and decrease payments by $0.3  million 
over five years from 2024 –25. Deferring the start date of the clean building managed 
investment trust withholding tax concession is estimated to have an unquantifiable impact 
on receipts over five years from 2024 –25. The Government has already provisioned for the 
measure to clarify arrangements for managed investment trusts.

The Government will strengthen the sanctions available to the Tax Practitioners Board 
(TPB), modernise the registration framework for tax practitioners and provide funding to 
the TPB to undertake additional compliance targeting high -risk tax practitioners over  
four years from 1  July 2025.  
This measure will protect taxpayers from tax agent misconduct, including poor and 
unlawful tax advice , and maintain community confidence in the integrity of the tax system. Treasury  |

It will also support the sustainability of the tax profession by increasing the ease of re ‑entry 
for tax and business activity statement agents who take career breaks.  
This measure forms part of the Government ’s response to the PwC matter and implements 
recommendations from the 2019 Independent Review of the Tax Practitioners Board.  
The Government will consult on the implementation details of the measure.  
This measure is estimated to increase receipts by $47.0  million and increase payments by 
$27.4  million over five years from 2024 –25.

The Government will increase the Medicare levy low ‑income thresholds for singles, 
families, and seniors and pensioners from 1  July 2024 to provide cost ‑of‑living relief. The 
increase to the thresholds ensures that low ‑income individuals continue to be exempt from 
paying the Medicare levy or pay a reduced levy rate.  
The increase to the thresholds is estimated to decrease receipts by $648.0  million over 
five years from 2024 –25. 
The threshold for singles will be increased from $26,000 to $27,222. The family threshold 
will be increased from $43,846 to $45,907. For single seniors and pensioners, the threshold 
will be increased from $41,089 to $43,020. The family threshold for senior s and pensioners 
will be increased from $57,198 to $59,886. The family income thresholds will increase by 
$4,216 for each dependent child or student, up from  $4,027.

The Government will deliver new tax cuts to every Australian taxpayer from 1  July 2026.  
These tax cuts are in addition to the first round of tax cuts for every taxpayer that the 
Government legislated last year, which have been rolling out since 1  July 2024.  
The new tax cuts will provide more cost -of-living relief and return bracket creep. They will 
also boost labour supply, particularly for women.  
Under the Government ’s new tax cuts:  
• From 1  July 2026, the 16  per cent rate will be reduced to 15  per cent.  
• From 1  July 2027, the 15  per cent rate will be reduced further to 14  per cent.  
This measure is estimated to decrease receipts by $17.1  billion over five  years from 2024 –25.  | Budget Paper No. 2

The Government will take action to ensure foreign investment in housing supports the 
Government ’s broader agenda to boost Australia ’s housing supply by:  
• Banning foreign persons (including temporary residents and foreign ‑owned companies) 
from purchasing established dwellings for two years from 1  April  2025, unless an 
exception applies. Exceptions to the ban will include investments that significantly 
increase housi ng supply or support the availability of housing on a commercial scale, 
and purchases by foreign ‑owned companies to provide housing for workers in certain 
circumstances.  
• Providing the Australian Taxation Office  (ATO)  $5.7 million over four  years from 
2025–26 to enforce the ban.  
• Providing the ATO  and Treasury $8.9  million over four years from 2025 –26 and 
$1.9 million per  year ongoing from 2029 –30 to implement an audit program and 
enhance the ir compliance approach to target land banking by foreign investors.  
The ban will mean Australians will be able to buy homes that would have otherwise been 
bought by foreign persons , while encouraging foreign persons to boost Australia ’s housing 
supply.  
The enhanced compliance approach by the ATO  and Treasury to target land banking will 
ensure foreign investors comply with requirements to put vacant land to use for residential 
and commercial developments within reasonable timeframes.  
This measure is estimated to decrease receipts by $90.0  million  and increase payments by 
$14.6  million over five years from 2024 –25. Treasury  |

The Government will strengthen the fairness and sustainability of Australia ’s tax system by 
providing $999.0  million over four years to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to extend 
and expand tax compliance activities.  
Additional funding includes:  
• $717.8  million over four years from 1  July 2025 for a two -year expansion and a one -year 
extension of the Tax Avoidance Taskforce . This supports the ATO ’s continued tax 
compliance scrutiny on multinationals and other large taxpayers.  
• $155.5  million over four years from 1  July 2025 to extend and expand the 
Shadow  Economy Compliance Program  to reduce shadow economy behaviour such as 
worker exploitation, under ‑reporting of taxable income, illicit tobacco and other shadow 
economy activity that enables non ‑compliant businesses to undercut competition.  
• $75.7  million over four years from 1  July 2025 to extend and expand the Personal Income 
Tax Compliance Program . This will enable the ATO to continue to deliver a combination 
of proactive, preventative and corrective activities in key areas of non -compliance.  
• $50.0  million over three years from 1  July 2026 to extend the Tax Integrity Program . This 
will enable the ATO to continue its engagement program to ensure timely payment of 
tax and superannuation liabilities by medium and large businesses and wealthy groups.  
This measure is estimated to increase receipts by $3.2  billion over five years from 2024 –25, 
and increase payments by $1.4  billion, including an increase in GST payments to the states 
and territories of $402.6  million and $31.0  million in unpaid superannuation to be 
disbursed to employees.

and before 1  July 2032  
• Sydney Chevra Kadisha for gifts received after 30  June  2025 and before 1  July 2030.  
The Government will enable Foundation Broken Hill Limited and Lord Mayor ’s Charitable 
Foundation to retain their specific listing status in the tax law, allowing them to undertake 
charitable activities unique to their communities that would otherwise fall outside the 
community charity DGR category. They will no longer be includ ed on a list of entities for 
DGR endorsement by the A ustralian Taxation Office as a community charity.  
This measure is estimated to decrease receipts by $4.5  million over five  years from 2024 –25.

The Government will increase support for hospitality venues, brewers, distillers and wine 
producers through changes to the alcohol tax settings in Australia, supporting local jobs 
and regional tourism.  
The Government will pause indexation on draught beer excise and excise equivalent 
customs duty rates for a two ‑year period, from August  2025. Under this measure biannual 
indexation of draught beer excise and excise equivalent customs duty rates due to occu r in 
August  2025, February  2026, August  2026, and February  2027 will not occur. Biannual 
indexation will then recommence from August  2027.  
The Government will also increase support available under the existing Excise remission 
scheme for manufacturers of alcoholic beverages  (the Remission scheme) and Wine Equalisation 
Tax (WET) producer rebate (Producer rebate). Currently, all eligible brewers and distillers 
can receive an excise remission under the Remission Scheme up to a cap of $350,000. All 
eligible wine producers can currently receive a WET rebate up to a cap of $350,000 under 
the Pr oducer rebate. This measure will increase the caps for a ll eligible brewers, distillers 
and wine producers to $400,000 per  financial year, from 1  July 2026.  
This measure is estimated to decrease receipts by $165.0  million over five  years from 
2024–25.

Payments for specific purposes  
In 202 5–26, the Australian Government will provide the states with $95.9 billion in 
payments for specific purposes. This represents an increase of $3.5 billion or 3.8 per cent 
compared with  the 202 4–25 estimate . This is  primarily due to increase d National Health 
Reform  funding , additional o ne-time funding for hospital  and related health services  and 
increased Better and Fairer  Schools funding. Payments for specific purposes are estimated 
to make up 12.2 per cent of total Australian  Government expenditure in 202 5–26 and 
3.3 per cent of GDP.  
Payments for National Health Reform  funding , Better and Fairer Schools  funding , the 
National Skills Agreement, the National Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness, 
Energy Bill Relief , and the National Access to Justice Partnership  are expected to total 
$71.2 billion in 202 5–26. 
National Partnership payments are expected to be $24.7 billion in 202 5–26. 
Chart 1. 1 shows estimated specific purpose payments to the states in 202 5–26 by sector.

Part 2: Payments for specific purposes  | Page 13  Part 2: Payments  for specific purposes  
Overview  
The Australian Government provides payments to state and territory governments (states) 
for specific purposes in policy areas for which the states have primary responsibility. These 
payments cover most areas of state and local government activity, including health, 
education, skills and workforce development, community services, housing, Indigenous 
affairs, infrastructure, and the environment.  
• Funding for public health and hospital  service s under the National Health Reform 
Agreement is the largest specific purpose payment to the states, estimated to be 
$32.2 billion  in 202 5–26. 
• Better and Fairer Schools funding is the second largest specific purpose payment to the 
states, estimated to be $32.2 billion in  2025–26, comprising funding for government 
schools of $12.2 billion and non -government schools of $ 19.9 billion.  
• In 202 5–26, the Australian Government is supporting the states in the skills and 
workforce development sector by providing $2.5 billion through the National Skills 
Agreement .  
• In 2025–26, the Australian Government is contributing  an estimated $1.8 billion under 
the National Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness. This f unding will 
support the effective operation of Australia ’s social housing and homelessness services 
and help those people at risk of or experiencing homelessness.  
• In 2025–26, the Australian  Government is committing an addition al $1.8 billion for 
Energy  Bill Relief.  
• In 2025–26, the Australian  Government is providing  $737.7 million under the 
National  Access to Justice Partnership  for improved justice outcomes for people 
experiencing vulnerability and financial disadvantage.  
National Partnership payments to the states are the key vehicle for facilitat ing reforms or 
support ing delivery of projects and services. Funding agreements are typically entered into 
for a fixed period of time, reflecting the nature of the project or reform involved.  
To the fullest extent possible, National Partnership payments are aligned to the 
achievement of milestones and are made after a state ha s achieved the outcomes or outputs 
specified in the relevant agreement. National Partnership payments are estimated to be 
$24.7 billion in 202 5–26. 
Funding agreements and other Commonwealth –state agreements are publicly available on 
the Federal Financial Relations website at: www.federalfinancialrelations.gov.au . Details of 
the appropriation mechanisms for all payments to the states and the terms and conditions 
applying to them are set out in Appendix  E, available online.

a) As state allocations for several programs have not yet been determined, these payments are not 
included in state totals. As a result, total payments may not equal the sum of state totals . Additionally, a 
slippage adjustment has been applied to Infrastructure Investment Program spending (included in the 
National Partnerships payments line) at the national level in 2024 –25 to 2027–28 to take account of 
historical experiences, including the timing of states claiming payments against milestones and the 
complexity of delivery. State totals are unaffected by the slippage assumption. The adjustment has been 
unwound over 202 8–29 to 203 3–34. 
b) National Health Reform Agreement funding estimates are based on the one -year extension to the

the states .

the National Partnership for Priority Groups COVID -19 Testing and Vaccination (which ceased on 
31 December 2023).  
b) Includes a one-off uplift in funding for the Northern Territory.  
 
National Health Reform funding is linked to growth in public hospital activity, the national 
efficient price and national efficient cost determined by the Independent Health and Aged 
Care Pricing Authority. The Australian Government funds up to 45  per cent of the efficient 
growth in the activity, price and cost of public hospital services, with growth in total 
Australian Government funding capped at 6.5  per cent a year.  
National Health Reform funding estimates are routinely updated to account for 
reconciliation outcomes, as well as for activity estimates provided by  states and the annual 
national efficient price and cost following determination.  
On 5 February 2025, the Commonwealth and  states agreed a one -year extension of the 
2020–2025 Addendum to the National Health Reform Agreement ( NHRA ) to provide 
financial certainty for public hospitals while the Commonwealth and states continue to 
work together on longer term health and disability reforms. The one -year extension 
provides states with $1.8  billion for a one -off funding boost for hospital and related health 
services through bilateral agreements and a one -off uplift to the Northern Territory.  Budget Paper No. 3  |  
 
Part 2: Payments for specific purposes  | Page 21 
As negotiations of a multi -year NHRA Addendum to embed the funding changes endorsed 
by National Cabinet in December  2023 are ongoing, the National Health Reform funding 
estimates are based on the current 2020–2026 NHRA Addendum. The Commonwealth has 
provisioned for its expected increase in funding as part of the future multi -year NHRA 
Addendum in the Budget .

a) State totals do not sum to the national total. A slippage adjustment has been applied to Infrastructure 
Investment Program spending at the national level in 2024 –25 to 2027 –28 to take account of historical 
experiences, including the timing of states claiming payments against milestones and the complexity of 
delivery. State totals are unaffected by the slippage assumption. The adjustment has been unwound 
over 2028 –29 to 2033 –34. 
 
The road investment component of the Infrastructure Investment Program delivers most of 
the Australian Government ’s investment in road infrastructure. It targets nationally 
significant projects that will improve the efficiency and safety of Australia ’s road network. 
Funding is provided for road construction projects and network maintenance, as well as 
transport development, innovation projects and grants to land transport research bodies.  
A portion of Australian Government funding for road infrastructure is sourced from the 
additional net revenue received from the reintroduction of fuel excise indexation in 2014 .

The Australian Government provides funding under the Disaster Recovery Funding 
Arrangements (DRFA) to assist the states in relief and recovery efforts following natural 
disasters. The Government recognises a liability equal to the present value of future 
payments expected to be made to the states under the DRFA. The liability is based on state  
data estimate s. It includes both known and future estimated expenditure for relief and 
recovery measures prior to states submitting a claim to the Australian  Governme nt.  
The total cost of relief and recovery from disaster events may not be completely realised for 
some years. The Government has provisioned $1.2 billion in the Contingency Reserve to 
fund these future costs.  
Current estimates for the DRFA are based on the information available about past events, 
at the time of preparation of this Budget . These estimates do not include other, as yet 
unquantifiable, disaster support payments that will be provided through the DRFA .

Estimated expenditure related to all natural disasters is regularly reviewed and revised by 
the states as new information becomes available, and this, or the occurrence of future 
natural disasters, can significantly affect the estimated DRFA liability and payments.

Part 3: General revenue assistance  | Page 121  Part 3: General revenue assistance  
Overview  
General revenue assistance is provided to state and territory governments (states), without 
conditions, to spend according to their own budget priorities. In 202 5–26, the states are 
expected to receive $100.6 billion from the Australian Government in total general revenue 
assistance, which is estimated to represent 25.0 per cent of total Australian Government 
expenditure in that year. This consists of the GST entitlement of $95.2 billion (comprising  
the GST pool  and the Commonwealth funded GST pool boost), horizontal fiscal 
equalisation (HFE) transition payments of $4.9 billion (also known as the No Worse Off 
guarantee)  and $533.5  million of other general revenue assistance.  
Total GST -related payments to the states (GST entitlements plus HFE transition payments) 
are estimated to increase from $100.1  billion in 202 5–26 and reach $117.2  billion by  2028–29.  
2025–26 is the f ifth year in the six-year transition to the updated GST distribution system, 
which will ensure that no state will have a per capita GST share lower than the fiscally 
stronger of New South Wales or Victoria. It is also the second  year that the GST relativity 
floor of 0.75 is in effect, which means a state ’s GST share cannot fall below this level. 
During this transition, the Australian  Government has guaranteed, through legislation, that 
each state will not receive less than they would have under the previous GST  distribution 
system by using, if necessary, HFE transition payments.  
In December  2023, the Australian Government agreed to extend this guarantee for three 
years until 2029–30. At the Council on Federal Financial Relations meeting on 
29 November  2024, the Commonwealth and  all states other than W estern Australia  agreed 
the Extension of the No Worse Off Guarantee funding  agreement , which formalised the 
extension of the guarantee.  
Estimated general revenue assistance provided to the states by the Australian  Government 
is shown in Table  3.1. Table  1.1 in Part  1 shows a breakdown by  state.

a) Estimates of the HFE transition payments for 202 6–27 and later years are based on the Commonwealth 
Grants Commission ’s recommended 2025–26 GST relativities and adjusted to take into account the 
transition to the new HFE system. The 2026 –27, 2027–28 and 202 8–29 HFE transition payment s are 
assumed to be 90 per cent, 85 per cent  and 80 per cent respectively of that implied using the 202 5–26 
GST relativities. At the time of the 2025 –26 Budget, the Treasurer had not yet made a determination of 
the 2025 –26 GST relativities.  
b) More detail about other general revenue assistance payments is provided in Table  3.7.

GST payments  
Under the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 , the states are entitled to receive payments 
from the Australian Government equivalent to the revenue raised from the GST in any 
given financial year, subject to some minor adjustments. From 2021 –22, the states ’ GST 
entitlements are boosted each year by additional Australian Government funding as 
described  below.  
The Australian Government makes monthly payments (advances) to the states throughout 
the year based on GST estimates for that year. Estimates of the GST are used because  the 
actual amount of GST revenue for the financial year is unknown until after the end of the 
financial year. Once the amount of GST revenue is known, the Treasurer makes a 
determination of the GST entitlement for that year. A balancing adjustment is made  to each 
state’s payment to ensure they receive the GST to which they are entitled. The se balancing 
adjustments (referred to as the ‘prior year balancing adjustment ’) are made in the following 
financial  year.  
Calculating the GST payments  
Adjustments and additions are made to GST revenue to calculate the amount of GST paid 
to the states in any given year. In particular, adjustments are made to move from GST 
revenue (an accrual concept) to GST receipts (cash) as GST receipts are the basis for the GST 
paid to the states.  
• Some GST revenue accrued during a financial year is not remitted to the 
Australian  Taxation Office (ATO) by 30  June of that year because it is not due to be paid 
until Business Activity Statements (BAS) are lodged in the following financial year. For 
taxpa yers other than Australian Government agencies, this accrued amount is included 
in GST revenue but not in GST receipts.  
• Penalties owed to the ATO, other than general interest charge (GIC) penalties, are not 
included in the GST to be paid to the states as defined in the Federal Financial Relations 
Act 2009 . 
• Some GST collected by Australian Government agencies is not remitted to the ATO by 
30 June in each financial year because it is not due to be paid until the next BAS is  
lodged. This amount is included in Australian Government receipts but is not included 
in GST payments to the states until it is remitted to the ATO.  
• From 2021 –22, the Australian Government is boosting the states ’ GST entitlement each 
year with additional funding. Since  2021–22, the Australian Government has injected 
$600.0  million annually into the GST pool, with this amount growing in line with the 
underlying growth of the GST. Since  2024–25, the Australian Government has further 
boosted  the GST pool by an additional $250.0  million annually. This additional funding 
is distributed to the states in the same way as GST revenue.  Budget Paper No. 3  |  
 
Part 3: General revenue assistance  | Page 123 
In 202 3–24, the states ’ GST entitlement was $ 759.7 million higher than the advances 
paid  during that year. A prior year balancing adjustment has been made to states ’ 
GST  payments in 202 4–25 to reflect this.

five years from 202 4–25 to 202 8–29. 
Excluding new policy decisions, the GST entitlement has been revised down by $5.1 million 
in 202 5–26 and by $902.6 million  over the five years from 202 4–25 to 202 8–29, driven by the 
change in GST receipts. GST receipts have been downgraded  over the forward estimates, 
primarily reflecting weaker -than -expected price pressures in the dwelling construction 
industry .

Distribution of the GST among the states  
The Australian Government distributes the GST among the states based on the 
GST  relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission (the  CGC).  
The detailed calculation for the distribution of the GST entitlement in 202 5–26 is shown in 
Table  3.5. This method of calculation is prescribed in the Federal Financial Relations Act  2009 . 
At the time of the 202 5–26 Budget, the Treasurer had not yet made a determination of the 
2025–26 GST revenue sharing relativities. The GST relativities in Table 3.5 use those 
recommend ed by the CGC  for 2025–26.

In 2018, the Australian Government reformed the system of HFE to provide a fairer way to 
distribute the GST among the states. From 2021 –22, the system began its transition to a 
more stable and predictable equalisation standard that will reduce volatility in states ’ GST 
payments.  
To support the states ’ transition to the new system, the Australian Government provided 
an additional $5.2  billion in transitional GST top -up payments over the three years to  
2021–22 to ensure that no state had an effective GST relativity below  0.7, or 4.66024 for the 
Northern Territory. At the time of the 2018 reforms, it was estimated that $1.8  billion in 
top-up payments would be required over those three years.  
From 2022 –23, the new HFE system included a relativity floor of 0.7, permanently 
increasing to 0.75 in 2024 –25. Further, the Australian Government has guaranteed that each 
state will receive at least the cumulative better of the old or the new HFE system f or the 
nine  years from 2021 –22 to 2029–30. The HFE transition payments associated with this 
guarantee are outlined in Table  3.1. 
The CGC does not forecast GST relativities beyond the budget year. The distribution of 
GST among the states and any resulting transitional payments beyond the budget year is 
calculated based on a technical assumption that uses the CGC’s recommended 2025–26 GST  
relativities as the starting point, adjusted to reflect the transition to the updated distribution 
system.  
In 2026–27, 2027–28, and 202 8–29, the transitional payments are assumed to be 90  per cent, 
85 per cent and 80  per cent respectively, of what would be expected using the 2025 –26 GST 
relativities.  Commodity prices are projected to fall from their current levels which will 
cause GST relativities to revert towards their historical averages. However, the three -year 
lag in the CGC ’s relativity calculations means that the reversion will be more gradual than 
previously anticipated. The estimates (shown in Table 3.1 ) do not reflect any attempt to 
project future GST relativities.   
 | Budget Paper No. 3  
 
 
Page 126 | Part 3: General revenue assistance  
The Australian Government is expected to provide an estimated $21.8 billion in HFE 
transition payments from 202 5–26 to 202 8–29 to support the transition to the 
new  HFE  system.  
GST administration  
States compensate the Australian Government for the costs incurred by the ATO for 
administering the GST, including by the Department of Home Affairs. In  practice, this is 
achieved by the Australian Government reducing the monthly GST payments to the states 
by the GST administration costs.  
The GST administration budget for the ATO is estimated to be $693.0 million for 202 5–26, 
as shown in Table  3.6.

Australian Capital Territory municipal services  
The Australian Government provides general revenue assistance to the Australian Capital 
Territory to assist in meeting the additional municipal costs that arise from Canberra ’s role 
as the national capital. The payments also compensate the Australian Capital Territory for 
additional costs resulting from the national capital planning influences on the provision of 
water and sewerage services.  
Royalty payments  
Western Australia  
The Australian Government provides general revenue assistance to Western Australia from 
royalties collected under the Offshore  Petroleum  (Royalty)  Act 2006  in respect of the 
North  West Shelf oil and gas project off the coast of Western Australia. The  Australian 
Government collects these royalties because it has jurisdiction over offshore areas.  
Royalties are shared between the Australian Government (approximately one third) and 
Western Australia (approximately two thirds). These revenue sharing arrangements are set 
out in the Offshore  Petroleum  and Greenhouse  Gas Storage  Act 2006 . 
Compensation for reduced  royalties  
The Australian Government provides general revenue assistance to compensate 
Western  Australia for the loss of royalty revenue resulting from the removal of the 
exemption of condensate from crude oil excise in the 2009–10 Budget .  
Mirror tax arrangements  
The Australian Government introduced mirror tax arrangements in 1998 to ensure that the 
states were not financially disadvantaged by the High Court decision in Allders  International 
Pty Ltd v Commissioner of State Revenue (Victoria) , which invalidated state taxes on 
Commonwealth places. These arrangements mirror certain state taxes, including payroll 
taxes, land taxes and stamp duties, with respect to Commonwealth places. The states collect 
these mirror taxes on behalf of the Austral ian Government and bear the administrative 
costs of collection.  
All mirror tax revenues are credited to the Australian Government and simultaneously 
appropriated to the states with no net impact on the Australian Government ’s budget 
position as shown in Table  3.8.

Fertility  
The projected  fertility rate s are based on analysis undertaken and commissioned by the 
Centre  (Table  A.3). Nationally, t he total fertility rate is forecast  to be 1. 44 babies per  woman 
in 202 4–25 before rising  to 1.6 2 by 20 31–32. Projected state fertility rates broadly  move in 
line with the national fertility rate.

Mortality  
Projected  life expectancy at birth is based on the Australian Government Actuary mortality 
improvement factors and the 2019 –21 Australian Bureau of Statistics life tables (Table A.4). 
Life expectancies have been adjusted until 202 8–29 to account for the impact of COVID -19 
on excess mortality . Life expectancies are then assumed to improve at the same average 
annual rate that has been observed over the past three decades. Projected state mortality 
rates broadly  move in line with the national mortality  rate.

Preface  | Page 1 Purpose of Budget Paper No. 4  
Budget Paper No. 4 presents information on the full allocation of resources across the 
General Government Sector. 1 In 2025–26, agencies will be responsible for managing  
approximately $785.7  billion  to deliver services for individuals, families and businesses.  
Budget Paper No. 4 sets out the departmental funding for agencies, administered 
funding managed by agencies , the nature of funding sources and the purposes of 
funding as defined by Outcome Statements for each agency.  
Additionally, information is provided on the staffing resources allocated to agencies 
delivering services to the Australian community.  
— 
1  The General Government  Sector provides public services that are mainly non -market in 
nature and for the collective consumption of the community or involve the transfer or 
distribution of income. These services are largely financed through taxes and other 
compulsory levies, user charging and exter nal funding (Budget 2025 –26, Budget Paper No. 1, 
Statement 9, Appendix  A).  
Preface  | Page 3 Preface  
The Australian  Government continues to deliver better outcomes for all Australians, 
through a stronger public service that reflects the community it serves.  Million s of 
Australians and Australian businesses interact with the Australian Public Service every day 
for a multitude of reasons. New parents engage with staff at Services Australia to process 
their parental leave claims and get their newborns added to their Me dicare card. Young 
people taking their first steps into the workforce will rely on staff at the Australian Taxation 
Office to generate their tax file number. A business may seek support on exporting 
products or receive a payment for an apprentice.  
It is public servants who process passports, and who are Border Force and biosecurity 
officers at airports and ports, protecting our borders and safeguarding Australian 
industries and the environment. Every day, Australian Federal Police officers and staff  
across Defence and Home Affairs work to protect our nation and keep Australians safe.  
Public servants working at Services Australia, the Bureau of Meteorology and the 
National  Emergency Management Agency prepare for, manage and coordinate disaster 
preparedness and relief responses, including most recently for Ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred.  
The public service is a truly national institution operating from 583 locations around 
Australia, in remote areas, regional towns and cities and in all state and territory capitals. 
These are public servants living in, working with and understanding the co mmunities they 
serve – assisting the government to respond to situations as they arise and ensur ing that 
decisions are carefully considered and well informed.  
Safe and quality care for our veterans, our children, people with a disability, and people in 
aged care is only possible due to the support provided by the public service, in partnership 
with many non -government organisations and businesses.  
Over successive budgets since the 2022 –23 October Budget, the Australian  Government has 
invested in the capacity, capability and strength of the public service . The 2025 –26 Budget 
continues to improve the delivery of government services , strengthen Australia ’s national 
security and build Australia ’s future.   
 | Budget Paper No. 4  
  
 
Page 4 | Preface  
Investing in an efficient public service  that delivers for 
Australians  
The role of the public service has changed over the past 20 years. New and emerging 
technologies, a growing and ageing population, the changing geo -strategic environment 
and increasing economic complexities mean s that the Australian  Government  has had to 
expand services and enter new fields of responsibility . 
The public service  is now  supporting the energy transition, delivering services like the 
National Disability Insurance Scheme  (NDIS) , managing the impacts of an ageing 
population, and managing heightened international and regional security challenges.  
Services Australia has grown in line with increased demand for services as the combined 
impact of our ageing population, changing demographics and new support payments like 
Paid Parental Leave, have driven a 35  per cent increase in Medicare and Centrelink claims 
since 2012.   
The Australian  Government has also established dedicated roles and functions to ensure 
that the Australian Public Service plays a leadership role in responding to issues of national 
importance. This includes the establishment of agencies such as the Australian Centre for  
Disease Control, the Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commission, the National 
Anti -Corruption Commission, the Australian Submarine Agency, the Office of the 
Inspector -General of Aged Care and the Net Zero Economy Authority.  
Investments since the 2022 –23 October Budget have rebuilt the public service to meet the 
expectations of the Australian community. At the same time, the relative size of the public 
service has remained below historical levels when measured as a proportion of the total 
Australian population and the labour force. Today, federal public servants make up 
1.5 per cent of the labour force and 0.8  per cent of the total population. In 2006 –07, federal 
public servants comprised 1.6 per cent of the labour force and 0. 8 per cent of the 
population . 
The Australian  Government ’s investment in Australia ’s public service capability has gone 
hand in hand with delivering on its election commitment  to reduce the public service ’s 
reliance on consultants, contractors, and labour hire. This has delivered $4.7  billion  in 
savings since the 2022 –23 October Budget, including an additional $718.8  million  in the 
2025–26 Budget.  
The Australian  Government has also delivered on its commitment to abolish the Average 
Staffing Level (ASL) cap. Under the previous government, the ASL cap placed arbitrary 
restrictions on the size of the public service  and led to agencies outsourcing their work to a 
shadow workforce comprising contractors, consultants, outsourced service providers and 
labour hire to deliver on the work that needed to be done. This resulted in an artificially 
low headcount of the public s ervice that came at a costly premium for taxpayers. The 
2021–22 Audit of Employment found that, in 2021 –22, 112  agencies across the public service Budget Paper No. 4  |  
 
Preface  | Page 5 
that employ ed staff under the Public Service Act 1999  had outsourced arrangements for 
53,900  staff on a full -time equivalent basis at a cost of $20.8  billion .  
While the ASL cap was in place, funding to government agencies continued to increase, 
while ASL growth was suppressed , directly leading to the overreliance on contractors and 
consultants.  Departmental spending rose 35.2  per cent in nominal terms between 2012 –13 
and 2021 –22, whereas ASL numbers fell by 4.5  per cent over the same period.   
The Australian  Government ’s APS  Strategic Commissioning Framework  seeks to rectify this 
by requiring core government work to be done by public service employees. The 
Australian  Government has also established an in -house consulting function, 
Australian  Government  Consulting, to support the public service to do its work in -house. 
The 2025 –26 Budget includes funding to continue the work of 
Australian  Government  Consulting which has directly displaced external consultancy 
spending, completing 19 projects since  its establishment in 2023, with additional projects 
underway.  
The Australian  Government ’s investment has rebalanced and rebuilt the capability of the 
public service, creating over 11,800 new public service roles to replace work previously 
undertaken by consultants and contractors. This accounts for more than a quarter of total 
ASL increases under the  Australian  Government, including 2,9 86 additional roles in the 
2025–26 Budget that are now being performed by public servants instead of through 
outsourced arrangements. This includes 2,603 ASL in the National Disability Insurance 
Agency to improve outcomes for NDIS participants and ensure every dollar of NDIS 
funding goes to those who need it most.

Page 6 | Preface  
Investing in the public service to improve services and 
support Australians  
The Australian  Government has significantly invested in frontline service delivery agencies 
across the country to deliver improved services and supports for Australians. As at 
June  2024 the majority (63  per cent) of the Australian Public Service was located outside of 
Canberra, with 1 2 per cent located in regional communities across Australia. Since the 
2022–23 October Budget, 71  per cent of all new Australian Public Service positions 
have  been created outside of Canberra.

Since the 2022–23 October Budget, the Australian  Government has invested in the capacity 
and capability of key service delivery agencies, including Services Australia, National 
Disability Insurance Agency, Department of Veterans ’ Affairs, and the Australian Taxation 
Office, as well as regulators such as the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission and the 
NDIS Quality and Safety Commission. Investments in the Department of Health and Aged 
Care and supporting agencies have also refl ected the Australian  Government ’s priorities to 
strengthen Medicare , ensure the viability and quality of aged care, and modernise the 
healthcare s ystem through My Health Record .   Budget Paper No. 4  |  
 
Preface  | Page 7 
Investing in Services  Australia  
An increase of over 3,400 staff since the 2022 –23 October Budget 
into Services Australia is ensuring Australians can get the help they 
need, when and where they need it. While the agency was 
temporarily resourced to respond to the COVID -19 pandemic and 
natural disaster events, its funding dropped off in the immediate aftermath in the 
former government ’s 2022–23 March Budget, resulting in a reduction in 
Service  Australia ’s customer service delivery workforce, and an overreliance on a 
contracted workforce. This meant that Services Australia was not able to maintain 
timely processing of incoming claims or provide the level of customer service which 
Australians expect.  
The Australian  Government ’s investment in new staff from November  2023 have 
supported:  
• the completion of 1.2  million  Centrelink claims and Medicare activities in 
2023–24  
• Aged Pension claims being processed 52  days faster  
• Medicare patient claims taking just two days to process instead of  seven  
• Paid Parental Leave claims taking three days to process instead of  31 
• PBS Safety Net processing times taking just two days instead of  146   
This means more financial supports are getting to Australians faster to help deal 
with cost -of-living pressures. Staff are also supporting Services Australia emergency 
response capability, to assist Australians in times of natural disasters and crisis, with 
over 18,600 calls being answered most recently for Ex -Tropical Cyclone Alfred.  
This investment of $4.0  billion  since the 2022 –23 October Budget in modernising 
Services Australia ’s service offer has also improved the customer experience, 
including improving and sustaining the myGov platform which is now one of the 
most downloaded and used apps in Australia,  with  864,000 logins per day as at 
30 June  2024. Over 1.6  million  customers have also accessed the Medicare Claims 
Tracker more than 3.9  million  times since August  2024.

Since the 2024 –25 Budget, the Australian  Government has continued to invest in the public 
service to improve service delivery and meet Australians ’ expectations of the services they 
need, including:  
• The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) to fulfil service standards for NDIS 
participants and for a new planning framework, and for the NDIS Quality and 
Safeguards Commission to improve the quality and safety of the NDIS supports.  
• Funding for the Department of Health and Aged Care to ensure the viability and quality 
of aged care and support a growing number of older Australians to remain in their 
homes as they age, through the new Support at Home  Program. Support has also been 
provided to ensure the viability of the sector, so that aged care providers can attract the 
investment needed to keep facilities open, improve quality and build new facilities.  
• Continued investment in a modernised My Health Record and the Australian Digital 
Health Agency to drive a digitally connected healthcare system for all Australians, 
ensuring Australians have a safe and secure place to keep their key health information, 
available at any time, including in an emergency. Since March  2022, the volume of 
My Health Records with data in them has grown by over 1.6  million , for a total of 
24.1 million  records as at December 2024. Records uploaded by healthcare providers 
have also gr own from 607  million  clinical and medicine records in March  2022, to over 
1.6 billion  as at December 2024. In addition, further resourcing across the Health and 
Aged Care portfolio has been provided to support primary care services and a 
regulatory model for vaping products.  
• Continuation of funding for the Department of Social Services to support the operation 
of the National Redress Scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse.  
• Protecting the integrity of the tax system by the Australian Taxation Office ’s compliance 
taskforce, which is securing additional tax revenue from large public groups, 
multinationals, wealthy individuals and private groups.  
This complements the Australian  Government ’s investments in the public service  since the 
2022–23 October Budget, with the Australian  Government committed to improving 
outcomes for Australians and enhancing the community ’s experience in interactions with 
Australian  Government  service providers, including:  
• Increasing NDIS baseline resourcing to support people with a disability to be more 
independent and ensure that every dollar of NDIS funding goes to those who need it 
most. The NDIS Fraud Fusion Taskforce has launched more than 500 investigations and 
referr ed 50 people to court. The NDIA has also supported thousands of NDIS 
participants who may have been impacted by fraudulent providers to transition to safer 
arrangements. Additional funding supports the NDIS Quality and Safeguards 
Commission to target disab ility support providers doing the wrong thing. This has 
resulted in 2,059 compliance and enforcement activity outcomes, including 1,218 
refusals of registration.  Budget Paper No. 4  |  
 
Preface  | Page 9 
• Implementation of the New Aged Care Regulatory Framework and address ing the 
findings of the 2023 Final Report – Independent Capability Review of the Aged Care Quality 
and Safety Commission . The report found the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission 
had significant issues in attracting and retaining staff, leading to poorer outcomes for 
older Australians. The Australian  Government ’s additional investment will support the 
Commission undertake its important role of ensuring the safety and wellbeing of older 
Australians.  
• Ensuring the Department of Veterans ’ Affairs is well resourced to support veterans and 
their families. The Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide  found the ASL cap 
led to more labour hire and higher staff turnover resulting in longer claims processing 
timeframes and poorer outcomes for veterans. The Australian  Government made it a 
priority over successive economic updates to provide significant resourcing for the 
Department of Veterans ’ Affairs, including 500 ongoing ASL in the 2022 –23 October 
Budget. This has helped clear a claims backlog of 41,799 claims, with over 98  per cent 
completed as at February 2025. Since 2022, an additional $13  billion  in payments to 
veterans has been made as a result of more claims being processed.  
• Investing in the Department of Education to safeguard the Child Care Subsidy program 
from fraud and non -compliance and target unsafe practices, and ensure child care 
workers are paid a fair wage, with a 15  per cent wage increase phased in by 
December  2026, all of which supports delivery of quality and safe services for 
Australian children.  
• Investing in the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to 
promote competition in markets and improved pricing to benefit consumers, business 
and communities. This includes for the Supermarket Inquiry 2024 –25 to review the 
price -setting practices and profit margins of our supermarkets, and pricing and 
charging behaviour of child care providers in its Childcare Inquiry 2023 . The newly 
established National Anti -Scam Centre within the ACCC has driven a 33  per cent 
reduction in scam losses report ed in 2024 compared to 2023. The 
Australian  Government has also implemented legislation to establish the Scams 
Prevention Framework to put Australia at the forefront of scam prevention and 
supporting consumers.  
• Supporting the Australian Taxation Office to target tax avoidance and fraud in our 
taxation system, go after shadow economies, and to work with industry and 
stakeholders on the Payday superannuation policy, to ensure employees are paid their 
super at the s ame time as their salary and wages. The Australian Taxation Office has 
also worked with employers to action unpaid super, with $932  million  of previously 
unpaid superannuation reaching the retirement accounts of 797,000 employees in 
2023–24. 
• Increasing the baseline resourcing of the Office of the e Safety Commissioner to continue 
to support Australians online, including for families and parents and older Australians, 
including through enhanced educational, outreach and investigatory activities.

Investing in the public service to secure our region, build 
resilience and protect Australians  
The Australian  Government has a strong focus on keeping Australians safe, both at home 
and overseas, in times of need and crisis. This includes in the areas of defence and national 
security, biosecurity, and building disaster and public health resilience and preparedness .  
From the 2022 –23 October Budget, the Australian  Government ’s investment in the public 
service has helped secure our region and protect our communities. Around 7, 730 additional 
staff have been engaged across agencies to protect Australia ’s national security, including 
Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Home Affairs, 
the Australian Federal Police, the Office of National Intelligence, the Attorney -General’s 
Department, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre,  and the Australian 
Submarine Agency .  
• Investing in Defence, and a strong Australian Defence industry, has created more jobs in 
regional communities, including for naval shipbuilding and nuclear -powered 
submarines. Establishing the Australian Submarine Agency has created 883 new jobs to 
support the delivery of a conventionally -armed nuclear -powered submarine capability 
for Australia, with significant benefits for Australian jobs within defence industry. This 
contributes to the delivery of the 2024 National Defence Strategy  and the 2024 Integrated 
Investment Program . The AUKUS Pillars I and II requires a highly skilled and specialised 
public service and industry workforce to deliver new and accelerated defence 
capability .  
• The Australian  Government has supported the capability of the Australian Federal 
Police, including its training, cyber investigations and protective security services. It has 
strengthened Australia ’s arrangements for high -risk terrorist offenders, with public 
servants across the Department of Home Affairs, Attorney -General’s Department and 
the Australian Federal Police working together to support community safety.  
• The Australian  Government has made significant investments in cyber security, with 
the establishment of the National Cyber Security Coordinator in the Department of 
Home Affairs to respond to major cyber incidents and additional resourcing to the 
Australian Federal Polic e to investigate and disrupt cyber crime. It is also working with 
business and industry, including telecommunication providers, hospitals and banks to 
improve their infrastructure and protect them from attacks.  
• With Australia as a member of the Pacific family, the Australian  Government is 
committed to the region ’s stability, security and its citizens ’ prosperity. Investment in 
the public service has supported more Australian Federal Police working across the 
Pacific to combat crime including through the Pacific Policing Initiative, and support 
Defence’s Pacific Maritime Security Program. Additional resourcing for the Department 
of Foreign Affairs and Trade has also supported the development of the Pacific Region, 
through the Official Development Assistance fund and the Australian Infrastructure 
Financing Facility for the Pacific.  Budget Paper No. 4  |  
 
Preface  | Page 11 
In the 2025 –26 Budget, the Australian  Government has made it a priority to go after the 
illicit black market tobacco trade, with public servants in the Australian Criminal 
Intelligence Commission, Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, Australian 
Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre,  Australian Federal Police, Australian Taxation 
Office, the Department of Health and Aged Care and the Department of Home Affairs 
working together to combine their expertise and specialist skills and help curb the ille gal 
market. This will help protect Australians from poorer health outcomes and cut off revenue 
to criminal gangs.  
In addition, public servants are helping to keep Australia free from diseases and protecting 
our agricultural industries, coordinating our national response to emergencies and 
resourcing our airports and ports. Investments by the Australian  Government include:  
• Establishing the Australian Centre for Disease Control, which will be permanently in 
place from 1  January  2026, to improve Australia ’s preparedness and response for public 
health emergencies. Public servants at the interim Australian Centre for Disease Control 
have been working to better connect state and territory data sets and further build the 
nation’s strengths and capabilities, drive better health outcomes for all Australians, and 
help protect the country from whatever nationally significant health thr eats it may face 
in the future.  
• Establishing the National Emergency Management Agency to support Australia ’s 
response and preparedness in the face of disasters such as Ex -Tropical Cyclone Alfred. 
Public servants working at the agency ensure Australian  Government  funding of up to 
$1 billion  through the Disaster Ready Fund is distributed to support impacted 
communities across the country, and enacts the National Coordination Mechanism to 
work collaboratively across the nation to find solutions to stabilise crises quickly.  
• Strengthened and sustainably funded biosecurity, to protect Australia ’s agriculture, 
wildlife and farming sector from outside pests and diseases. This includes protecting 
Australia against the recent global threat of a serious and highly contagious H5 bird flu 
strain that has moved quickly around the world, but with Australi a currently the only 
continent free from this stain. Investment has also supported actions to address the 
border and biosecurity threats from illegal fishing activities around Australia ’s northern 
waters.  
• Additional biosecurity officers and Australian Border Force staff at seaports in 
Wyndham, Dampier and Ashburton, for front -line biosecurity services to enforce 
Australia ’s rigorous biosecurity standards, and ensure people and goods entering and 
leaving Australia adhere to our strict border controls. In addition, more border staff and 
biosecurity officers are supporting airports across the country, including in Perth, 
Newca stle, Sunshine Coast, Broome, Hobart and Western Sydney.

Page 12 | Preface  
Investing in our public service to support Australia ’s 
economic transformation  and build a stronger economy  
The Australian  Government has made targeted investments in public service capacity to 
implement the reforms that are needed to advance Australia ’s economic transformation. 
This is delivering the energy transition necessary to effectively address climate change, 
while supporting our energy, resources, small business sectors, and investing in skills, 
training and employment pathways to create jobs an d boost the economy.  
Investment in the public service continues to support significant policies and programs to 
drive our country ’s climate action, to transform our energy system to deliver cheaper, more 
reliable power, conserve, protect and sustainably manage our natural resources, support 
our businesses and invest in targeted skills, training and employment measures to support 
our economic transformation, including:  
• Establishing the Net Zero Economy Authority to promote a net zero economic 
transformation for Australia through facilitating investment, supporting workers, 
fostering inclusive engagement, and ensuring coherent and effective policies to 
empower communities , regions, and industries.  
• Additional resourcing in the Industry, Science and Resources and Climate Change, 
Energy, the Environment and Water portfolios is driving the Future Made in Australia 
agenda, including administering the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund. This 
include s working with states and territories and industry to modernise our electricity 
grid, supporting the $1  billion  Household Energy Upgrades Fund to help homeowners 
fast track their transition to cheaper, cleaner energy, and establishment of the National 
Reco nstruction Fund to support Australian projects that drive high -value industry 
transformation.  
• Over 375 staff at the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and 
Water continue to improve the on -time approval rate of environmental approvals. This 
builds on the Australian  Government ’s establishment and resourcing of the Department 
in the 2022 –23 October Budget to lead the Australian charge to fight climate change, 
support our industries, and protect our environment. Environment approvals processed 
by public servants have doubled the average on -time rate, with one large solar farm 
approved within 20 working days.  
• Supporting the Whyalla Steelworks to protect local jobs and facilitate longterm 
transformation of the Australian steel industry.  
• Investing in the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Securities and 
Investments Commission to continue their support for small businesses. This includes 
going after illegal phoenix activity by businesses, which often directly impacts 
sub-contractors, creditors and employees as they are left unpaid and out of pocket, and 
upgrades and stabilisation of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission 
business registers, which reported more than 318  million  searches of their registers in 
2024 and 3.2 million  updates processed.  Budget Paper No. 4  |  
 
Preface  | Page 13 
• Partnering with states and territories to put TAFE at the heart of the Vocational 
Education and Training sector, through the establishment of Free TAFE and continuing 
to build a national network of TAFE Centres of Excellence. This investment creates 
opport unities for individuals as well as builds the future of our country.  
• Additional resourcing to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations to 
support reforms to employment and pre -employment services programs, to ensure 
everyone in Australia can access secure jobs and participate in the Australian labour 
market. This includes working with employment providers and families through the 
new voluntary Parents Pathway to provide personal ised assistance and financial 
support to eligible parents and carers. Public servants also work with Australian 
employers through the Pac ific Australia Labour Mobility Scheme so that they can hire 
workers from the Pacific and Timor Leste when there are not enough local workers 
available. This helps fill labour gaps in rural and regional Australia, and in the 
agriculture and agriculture -related food product manufacturing sectors.  
Building Australia ’s Future  
An investment in our public service and its capability is an investment in the future 
security and prosperity of Australia. The Australian  Government recognises that it cannot 
deliver outcomes for Australians without the foundations of a strong public service.  
While the Australian  Government has made great progress in rebuilding the public service 
after almost a decade of outsourcing, underinvestment and reduced service outcomes, this 
is a multiyear project that requires  continued commitment .  
The 2025 –26 Budget continues that work to ensure that the public service can keep 
delivering critical services, stepping up when times are difficult and working to build 
Australia ’s future.

Introduction and guide  | Page 15  Introduction and guide to  
Budget  Paper No.  4 
The purpose of Budget Paper No.  4 is to provide a whole of government view of estimated 
resourcing managed in the Budget year and previous year by agencies (which are 
non-corporate Commonwealth entities, corporate Commonwealth entities and 
Commonwealth companies) in the General Government Sector (GGS). The resources 
include financial resources, staff resources, expenses and net capital investment.  
The Budget  Papers do not authorise appropriations or impose legal obligations on the 
Commonwealth.  
Budget Paper No.  4 contains three main parts and an appendix with tables of information 
as follows:  
Part 1  Agency Financial Resourcing  
1.1 Agency Resourcing Table  
1.2 Special Appropriations Table  
1.3 Special Accounts Table  
Part 2  Staffing of Agencies  
Part 3  Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
3.1 Departmental Expenses Table  
3.2 Net Capital Investment Table  
Appendix A: Agency Outcome Statements  
The Agency Financial Resourcing tables present appropriation information by portfolio 
and then by agency. Estimated resourcing is presented on a cash basis for both the 
Budget  year and previous year (which is printed below the Budget year in italics, or to 
the left of the Budget year in a separate column). The tables include agencies, Outcomes, 
special appropriations and special accounts, and estimates of annual appropriations and 
external revenue, as well as staffing for the 2024 –25 and 2025 –26 years.  
Estimates contained in the Budget Papers incorporate assumptions and judgements based 
on the best information available at the time of publication.

Page 16 | Introduction and guide  
Transfer of resourcing between agencies  
Agencies may, over the course of a financial year, transfer amounts of resourcing to other 
agencies, as a result of restructuring, legislative changes, Executive decisions and 
machinery of government changes enacted by amendments to the 
Administrative  Arrangements Order (AAO). Resourcing, at the date of change and 
afterwards, is reflected against the agency that gains the resources. Resourcing prior to the 
date of change is reflected against the agency that formerly managed the resources.  
Annual Appropriation Bills and Acts  
Throughout Budget Paper No. 4, references to annual appropriations and 
Appropriation  Bills for 20 25–26 should be t aken to include the relevant Supply Bills2 and 
Appropriation Bills .3 
Annual appropriation amounts appearing for 202 4–25 include the relevant 
Appropriation  Acts .4 
  
— 
2  The Supply Bills are: Supply Bill (No. 1) 2025 –2026, Supply Bill (No. 2) 2025 –26 and Supply 
(Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2025 –2026. The Supply Bills will provide funding 
for the ongoing business of the Government in the first five months of 2 025–26. Funding will 
be calculated as approximately 5/12ths of entities ’ 2025–26 annual appropriations for the 
annual ordinary services  of the Government, and additional amounts where the expenditure 
of some agencies is weighted towards the earlier months of the year.  
3  The Appropriation Bills are: Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2025 –2026, App ropriation Bill (No. 2) 
2025–26 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2025 –2026.

Guide to Resourcing Tables  
Linkages between tables and amounts presented in Budget Paper No.  4 are illustrated in 
Figures 1 to 4. A consolidated view of financial resources to be managed by agencies is 
presented in the Agency Resourcing Table. Amounts in the Agency Resourcing Table can 
be matched with information in the:  
• annual Appropriation Bills  
• Special Appropriations Table  
• Special Accounts Table.  
Figures 1 and 2 show how amounts in the Agency Resourcing Table can be matched with 
amounts in the annual Appropriations Bills. The Figures also highlight amounts in these 
Bills for non -operating expenditure and for payments to the States, Territories and 
local governments.  
Figures 3 and 4 show how amounts in the Agency Resourcing Table can be matched with 
amounts in the Special Appropriations Table and the Special Accounts Table.

Appropriations Framework  
An appropriation is a legal entitlement to draw money from the Consolidated Revenue 
Fund (CRF). Appropriations are either annual appropriations or special appropriations. 
Annual appropriations are contained in the annual Appropriation Acts. Special 
appropriations are contained in other Acts.  
The CRF is a concept established in section  81 of the Constitution to represent all 
Commonwealth money. All revenues or moneys raised or received by the Executive 
Government of the Commonwealth, or any person or organisation acting on behalf of the 
Commonw ealth, automatically form part of the CRF. This includes for example taxes, 
charges, levies, borrowings, loan repayments and moneys held on behalf of others or in 
trust. Money automatically forms part of the CRF upon receipt, regardless of whether the 
mone y is deposited in a bank account.  
Section 83 of the Constitution provides that no money shall be drawn from the 
Treasury  of the Commonwealth except under an appropriation made by law 
(the ’Treasury ’ of the Commonwealth equates to the CRF). Section  81 provides that 
appropriations from the CRF  must  be applied for expenditure of the Commonwealth. 
Together, sections  81 and 83 provide that before money may be spent there must be an 
appropriation, made by law, for the purposes of the Commonwealth. These requirements 
for an appropriations framewor k safeguard the constitutional control by the Parliament 
over Australian  Government  spending.  
The appropriations and expenditure framework for agencies in the Australian  Government 
is based on the accounting concept of control. Where an agency has substantial control, the 
related appropriation and expenditure is classified as departmental  and where an agency 
does not have control, expenditure is classified as administered.  This classification is unique 
to government and is not used elsewhere in the Australian economy and is in accordance 
with the Australian Accounting Standard AASB 1050 Administered  Items.  Whether an 
agency has administered or departmental  control over resources is based largely on the level 
of discretion the agency has in using those resources.  
Departmental  appropriations are available to meet expenditure over which an agency has 
substantial control and are typically used for agency operational expenditure, such as for 
employees and supplier expenses. Administered  appropriations are administered by an 
agency on behalf of the government for the benefit of, or payment to, parties who are 
external to the agency and not part of the internal operations of that agency.  
Administered  appropriations are typically used for expenditure such as government 
grants, subsidies and obligations that arise from legislated eligibility rules and conditions. 
Further information on the appropriations framework can be found on the Finance website.

Page 24 | Part 1: Agency Financial Resourcing  
Machinery of Government Changes  
The term ‘machinery of government changes ’ (MoG changes) describes a variety of 
organisational or functional changes affecting the Commonwealth. MoG changes often 
arise from amendments to the Administrative Arrangements Order (AAO) following a 
Prime Ministerial decision to abolish or create a depa rtment or to move functional 
responsibilities between agencies.  
Since the 2024 –25 Budget, there have been a number of AAO amendments and other 
Government decisions resulting in the following MoG changes:  
• establishment of the Administrative Review Tribunal as a non -corporate 
Commonwealth entity in the Attorney -General’s portfolio. The Administrative Review 
Tribunal replaces the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, formerly a non -corporate 
Commonwealth entity in the same portfolio, which was abolished  
• establishment of the National Commission for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
Children and Young People as a non -corporate Commonwealth entity in the Social 
Services portfolio  
• establishment of the Net Zero Economy Authority as a non -corporate Commonwealth 
entity in the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio  
• abolishment of the National Mental Health Commission, a non -corporate 
Commonwealth entity in the Health and Aged Care portfolio. The Department of  
Health and Aged Care, in the same portfolio, adopted the functions of the National  
Mental Health Commission  
• transfer of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, a non -corporate 
Commonwealth entity, from the Home Affairs portfolio to the 
Attorney -General’s portfolio  
• transfer of responsibility for business registers from the Australian Taxation Office 
to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission  
• transfer of emergency management support functions of the Australian Climate Service 
from the Bureau of Meteorology to the National Emergency Management Agency.  
The AAO documents and further information on AAOs can be found on the website of the 
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, or on the Federal Register of Legislation. 
For information on how MoG changes impact on portfolios, refer to the 
2024– 25 Portfolio  Additional Estimates Statements and the  2025–26 Portfolio Budget Statements  
of relevant portfolios.

Part 1: Agency Financial Resourcing  | Page 25 
Advance to the Finance Minister  
The Advance to the Finance Minister (AFM) provisions under the annual Appropriation 
Acts enable urgently required allocations to be issued to entities during the financial year. 
Allocations are made through a determination by the Minister for Finance up to  a statutory 
limit in the annual Appropriation Acts.  
In 2024–25, AFM provisions totalling $1  billion were available across 
Appropriation  Acts (Nos. 1 and 2) 2024 –2025  for other urgent and unforeseen expenditure.  
At the time of publication, no AFMs have been issued under the 
2024–25 annual  appropriations.  
The Supply Bills (Nos. 1 and 2) 2025 –2026 (known as the Supply Bills) will be introduced to 
provide for interim supply beyond 1 July 2025. Supply Bills are usually required when an 
election is due in close proximity to the end of the financial year, because a normal sitting 
calendar would not  afford enough time for the Appropriation Bills (Nos. 1 and 2) 
2025–2026 (known as the Budget Bills) to secure their passage.  
Together the Supply and Budget Bills present a complete view of the expected annual 
appropriations for the coming financial year (respectively covering the first five months 
and the remaining seven months of 2025 –2026). The Budget Bills also include the 
2025–2026  Budget measures.  
The Supply Bills include two separate AFM provisions, comprising:  
• $400  million in Supply Bill (No. 1) 2025 –2026  
• $600  million in Supply Bill (No. 2) 2025 –2026.  
The Budget Bills replicate the AFM splits in the Supply Bills, with the exception that no 
more than $1 billion in total can be allocated across the Supply Bills and the Budget Bills 
(if both set of Bills are enacted). Given the proximity of the Budget to the period when an 
election is due to be called, the Budget Bills are likely to lapse when the Parliament is 
dissolved, which means that successor appropriation Bills (which will contain the same 
titles as the Budget Bills) must be introduced after the elec tion. The total AFM allocation 
limit will remain at no more than $1 billion across the Supply Acts and the successor 
Bills  (once enacted).  
Further information on AFMs allocated in prior years can be found on the Finance website.

Overview of Agency Resourcing Table  
The Agency Resourcing Table presents a consolidated view of estimated Commonwealth 
public sector financial resources, which will be managed in the Budget year by agencies, 
that is, Commonwealth entities and Commonwealth companies subject to the 
Public  Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 .5 The Agency Resourcing Table is 
organised by portfolio and agency, and by agency Outcome .6 Corporate Commonwealth 
entities are denoted by a * in the Agency Resourcing Table and Commonwealth companies 
are denoted by a #.  
The Agency Resourcing Table differentiates the sources of funding, which are annual 
Appropriation Bills, External Revenue, Special Appropriations and Special Accounts. The 
amounts are classified into departmental and administered  resourcing, except for special 
accounts, which can be classified as either or both. The Agency Resourcing Table includes 
inter -governmental transactions, which occur when one agency in the GGS pays another 
agency in the GGS for goods and/or services. To eliminate inter -governmental  transactions 
would not accurately represent the financial resources managed by a particular agency.  
Amounts in the Agency Resourcing Table can be matched with amounts in the annual 
Appropriation Bills, Special Appropriations Table and Special Accounts Table. 
Examples  are in Figures 1 to 4 of the section entitled Guide to Resourcing Tables.  
Appropriations for corporate entities, shown as administered  in the annual Appropriation 
Bills, are regarded as departmental  funding when received by the corporate entities. This is 
consistent with accounting and reporting requirements and shown as such in the 
Agency  Resourcing Table.  
  
— 
5  The total amounts in the Agency Resourcing Table cannot be used to calculate consolidated 
Commonwealth financial resources. This is because they do not include Public Financial 
Corporations, Public Non -Financial Corporations and the Australian National University. 
These are public corporations that typically operate in the commercial sphere, are not in the 
GGS, and are mostly self -funded. Further information on the nature and classification of

Appendix  A: Agency Outcome Statements.  Budget Paper No. 4  |  
 
Part 1: Agency Financial Resourcing  | Page 27 
The column headed External Revenue  in the Agency Resourcing Table presents income 
received from sources that are not appropriated by Parliament to the agency, including 
amounts received from other government agencies, individuals, and non -government 
bodies. In large part, these amounts are for the provision of services.  
The column headed Special Accounts in the Agency Resourcing Table shows estimated 
amounts to be credited to one or more special accounts. This column presents estimated 
income expected from other government agencies, individuals and non -government 
bodies. This column is located between the departmental  and administered  sides of the 
Agency Resourcing Table because depending on the legislated purposes of a special 
account, the resources may be used for departmental  and/or administered  expenditure. 
It is consistent with amounts presented in the Receipts (non -appropriated)  column of the 
Special  Accounts Table.  
The Agency Resourcing Table includes only those special appropriations and special 
accounts that have been established in law at the time of publication. The Agency 
Resourcing Table and Special Accounts Table exclude moneys held by an agency on trust 
for a person other than the Commonwealth. These amounts are n ot considered resourcing 
available to the agency, as they are not held on account of the Common wealth and are not 
for the use or benefit of the Commonwealth .

d) The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) is a corporate Commonwealth entity and as such is not required to report expe nses separately as 
administered  or departmental.  However, the NDIA ’s expenses incurred in the provision of reasonable and necessary support to clients ( administered  in nature) 
will be significant over the forward estimates compared to other corporate Commonwealth entities. These expenses are jointly funded by the Commonwealth 
and participating States and Territories and reflected as D epartmental External Revenue. All agency operational costs ( departmental  in nature) are funded by 
the Commonwealth through the Appropriation Bills. Table  3.1: Departmental Expenses Table also shows the split between NDIA expenses that are 
departmental  or administered  in nature and provides a total excluding NDIA expenses that are administered  in nature.

Special Appropriations Table  
Overview of the Special Appropriations Table  
The Special Appropriations Table lists Acts that contain one or more special 
appropriations. Acts are listed by portfolio and responsible agency, consistent with the 
most recent AAO.  
Special appropriations are those appropriations contained in Acts other than the annual 
Appropriation Acts.  
Special appropriations can be limited or unlimited in terms of amount or time. A small 
number of Acts may also stipulate a maximum amount appropriated for the particular 
purpose. Expenditure funded by a special appropriation is often triggered by legislati ve 
eligibility criteria and conditions. An example of expenditure that is met using a special 
appropriation is aged pensions paid under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 . 
The Summary of Special Appropriations Table presents total portfolio resourcing that is 
supported by special appropriations. Only those special appropriations that have been 
established in law at the time of publication are included in the Special Appropri ations 
Table and Summary of Special Appropriations Table.  
The detailed Special Appropriations Table presents estimated resourcing required for each 
agency by Act that is supported by special appropriations. For each agency, the aggregated 
total for all Acts in the Special Appropriations Table can be matched with the total Special 
Appropriation  amount in the Agency Resourcing Table. For an example of this matching, see 
Figure  3 of the  Guide to Resourcing Tables  section. Where no resourcing is expected to be 
required during the Budget or comparator year, the relevan t Acts have not been included 
in the Special Appropriations Table.  
A complete list of Acts with provisions containing special appropriations can be found in 
the Chart of Special Appropriations,  which is available on the Finance websi te.

Special Accounts Table  | Page 123 
Special Accounts Table  
Overview of the Special Accounts Table  
A special account is an appropriation mechanism that sets aside an amount within the CRF 
for specific expenditure purposes. Special accounts can be used to appropriate for 
expenditure that is resourced from contributions from other parties, such as other 
governments, contributions from industry or members of the community. Special accounts 
can also be credited with amounts from annual appropriations and speci al appropriations 
(including other special accounts), if those amounts were appropriated for the same 
purpose as the special account. Special accounts can be credited with amounts held on trust 
– these amounts are not shown in the Special Accounts Table as  they are not considered 
resourcing available to the agency.  
The Summary of Special Accounts Table presents total portfolio resourcing that is expected 
to be provided by other agencies, individuals and non -government bodies.  
The Special Accounts Table lists special accounts by portfolio and responsible agency. For 
each special account, the Special Accounts Table shows the estimated opening balance for 
the Budget and comparator years, estimated cash inflows and outflows (receip ts and 
payments) during the year, and estimated closing balance at the end of the Budget and 
comparator years. Estimated resources for the comparator year are printed in italics. Where 
responsibility for managing a special account is moved between agencies  during the year, 
the part year impact for each agency is shown.  
The column headed Receipts (Non -Appropriated)  shows estimated amounts to be credited to 
a special account, which are received from other agencies, individuals, and 
non-government bodies. The column headed Receipts (Appropriated)  shows amounts 
estimated to be credited to a special account, which are appropriated to the agency in an 
annual Appropriation Act or another Act containing a special appropriation (including 
other special accounts).  
Amounts for an agency in the Special Accounts Table column headed Receipts 
(Non -Appropriated) can be matched with the Agency Resourcing Table column headed

Estimates of Average Staffing Levels of Agencies in the 
Australian General Government Sector  
This Part reports on Average Staffing Levels (ASL) at the portfolio and agency level. Data is 
presented for two years – the Budget year (2025 –26) and the preceding year  (2024–25). The 
ASL reported is updated from the 2024 –25 Budget .  
Data for 2025 –26 reported in Table  2.2 represent ASL estimates provided by general 
government sector (GGS) agencies. ASL figures reflect the average number of employees 
receiving salary or wages over the financial year, with adjustments for casual and part -time 
employees to show the full -time equivalent. It also includes uniformed employees and 
overseas personnel. The ASL figures exclude external labour. Any minor discrepancies in 
totals are due to rounding of partial ASL.  
Data for 2024 –25 reported in Table  2.2 represent the revised ASL estimate provided by 
GGS  agencies . Caution should be taken when comparing these estimates with estimates 
from other years (in this Budget or previous budgets). Actual ASL outcomes realised by 
agencies can differ to estimates previously provided by agencies.  
The staffing of agencies in 2024 –25 and 2025 –26 
At the 2025 –26 Budget across the GGS (excluding military and reserves):  
• The ASL estimate for 2025 –26 is 213,349.  
• The revised ASL estimate for 2024 –25 is 209,913 which is 763 above the estimated level 
(209,150) at the time of the 2024 –25 Budget.  
Changes in ASL estimates compared to the previous year largely reflect additional 
conversions of external labour to ASL positions, but also reflect the Government ’s 
decisions  since the 2024 –25 Budget and the impact of agencies ’ recruitment strategies 
and workforce planning decisions to manage staffing levels within their existing 
departmental  appropriations.  
Estimated ASL in 2025 –26 reflects the Australian  Government ’s ongoing investments 
to resource the public sector to respond to demand for new and expanded government 
services, policy and regulatory responses. This includes resourcing for frontline service 
delivery through the National Disability Insurance Agency and the Aged Care Quality an d 
Safety Commission. The Government has also invested in resourcing to secure our borders 
and protect Australians, including through the  Department of Defence, Australian 
Submarine Agency, Australian Federal Police, and the Department of Home  Affairs.

Page 154 | Part 2: Staffing of Agencies  
Measuring the size of the public service  
In addition to the ASL estimates published each year in Budget  Paper No.  4, the 
Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) and the Australian  Bureau of 
Statistics (ABS) also publish estimates of the size of the public service. These data 
sources are complementary but not  directly comparable.  
• ASL reported in Budget Paper No. 4 is the annual average number of full -time 
equivalent employees who work in the General Government Sector (GGS) . This 
measure includes : ongoing and non -ongoing employees; an adjustment for work 
hours per  person; and the employees of agencies in the GGS  but not those 
employed outside  the Public Service Act  1999.  
• In the twice -yearly  APS Employment Data release, the APSC publishes 
headcounts of ongoing and non -ongoing employees, not adjusted for work hours 
per person, employed under the Public Service Act  1999  as at 30  June or 
31 December each year.  
• In the annual Public Sector Employment and Earnings release, the ABS publishes 
the number of ongoing and non -ongoing employees, not adjusted for work hours 
per person, employed by the Australian  Government. This includes Defence 
personnel and those employed outside the Public Service Act  1999 , who are paid 
over one month, typically the month of June each  year.

Part 2: Staffing of Agencies  | Page 155 
Reducing reliance on contractors, consultants and labour hire  
Since the 2024 –25 Budget, the Government has further reduced the 
Australian  Public  Service’s (APS’s) reliance on contractors, consultants and labour 
hire (collectively  known  as external labour). Consistent with the Government ’s election 
commitment s and the APS  Strategic Commissioning Framework , the Government has agreed 
additional conversions in 2025 –26 of almost 3,000  roles  previously undertaken by external 
labour to public service roles (see Table  2.1). This accounts for 87 per cent of the increase in 
ASL  between the revised ASL estimate for 2024 –25 and the ASL estimate for  2025–26. 
This represents a further rebalancing of the APS workforce to reduce the reliance on 
external labour where the work can appropriately be done by APS staff. Since 
the 2022–23 October  Budget, the Government has created over 11,800 public service roles to 
replace work previously undertaken through outsourced arrangements. This accounts for 
more than a quarter of the total increase to public service staffing levels since  2022–23.

Part 3: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  | Page 169  Part 3: Expenses and Net Capital Investment  
This part reports on departmental expenses and net capital investment, by agency. The data 
is presented on the same basis as data in Statement 5 of Budget Paper No. 1. Both sets of 
data are presented on the basis of external accounting and financial reporting standards. 
These standards present information in terms of accrued expenses and accrued revenue.  
The external standards used for budget reporting purposes are:  
• the Australian Bureau of Statistics ’ accrual Government Finance Statistics (GFS) 
publication , Australian System of Government Finance Statistics: Concepts, Sources and 
Methods, 2015  (cat no. 5514.0), which is based on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
accrual GFS framework  
• the Australian Accounting Standards, issued by the Australian Accounting Standards  
Board (AASB), which includes International Financial Reporting Standards as  adopted  
in Australia for use by the not -for-profit sector and specific standards such as  
AASB  1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial Reporting  
(AASB  1049).  
Machinery of government changes have implications for how information is presented in 
the tables in this part. For example, if an agency was abolished in a particular year, it will 
have estimated expenses reflecting expenditure in part of that year. If an agency was 
created in a particular year, it will have estimated expenses for both that year and 
forward  years.

Departmental Expenses Table  
Table 3.1 presents departmental expenses by agency. Departmental expenses reduce the net 
worth of agencies. It includes expenses controlled by agencies such as payment of wages 
and purchases of goods and services. It excludes administered expenses – not co ntrolled by 
agencies – paid on behalf of government such as social benefits and grants to the States. It 
also excludes net capital investment, which does not reduce net worth.

a) Estimates of inter -agency transactions are included in the whole -of-government and inter -agency 
amounts. The entry for each portfolio does not include eliminations for inter -agency transactions within 
that portfolio.  
b) Agency estimates  include net write down and impairment of assets and fair value losses. For 
Australian  government reporting these are considered other economic flows.  
c) The National  Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA ) is a corporate Commonwealth entity and as such is not 
required to report expenses separately as administered  or departmental . However, the NDIA ’s expenses 
incurred in the provision of reasonable and necessary support to clients ( administered  in nature) will be 
significant over the forward estimates compared to other corporate Commonwealth entities. Additionally, 
these expenses are jointly funded by the Commonwealth and participating states and territories. 
To provide a better view of these NDIA expenses, Table  3.1 shows the split between expenses that are 
departmental  or administered  in nature and provides a total excluding NDIA that are administered  
in nature.

 Appendix A: Agency Outcome Statements  
This appendix provides a table of the Outcomes managed by each agency. It assists users to 
understand the Agency Resourcing  Table.  
The Outcome statements are listed by portfolio, in the order of: portfolio department(s) of 
state, corporate Commonwealth entities (*) and Commonwealth companies (#), and then 
other agencies. Within these categories, agencies are listed alphabetically by official name. 
This is the same order as displayed in the annual Appropriation Bills and the Agency 
Resourcing  Table.  
Outcome statements articulate Government objectives and serve three main purposes:  
• to explain the purposes for which annual appropriations are approved by the 
Parliament for use by agencies.  
• to provide a basis for budgeting and reporting against the use of funds.  
• to measure and assess non -financial performance in contributing to Government 
policy  objectives.  
• This appendix contains approved Outcome statements for GGS agencies. It does not 
include agencies that are not within the GGS, such as Public Financial Corporations or 
Public Non -Financial Corporations.  
Further information on the nature and structure of these agencies can be found in the 
Flipchart of PGPA Act Commonwealth entities and companies , which is available on the

  Page iii Support and note on data  
Support  
This Statement includes information that  may  be distressing for some readers. It outlines 
the tragic impacts of violence against women, including sexual assault, as well as issues 
such as suicide and self -harm. The Government respectfully acknowledges and regrets the 
loss of those who have died,  and the harm caused to those who are affected by violence, 
suicide or self -harm.  
Help is available. Lifeline provides 24 -hour support in Australia for those experiencing a 
personal crisis and can be contacted by calling 13 11 14 or visiting lifeline.org.au. If  you, or 
someone you know, is experiencing family, domestic or sexual violence, you can contact 
1800RESPECT (1800  737 732) or visit 1800respect.org.au  for support.  
Note about data  
This Statement endeavours to include data and analysis to demonstrate the outcomes 
experienced by different groups of women, including Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander 
women, culturally and linguistically diverse  communities , women with disability, women 
of different ages, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer, asexual or other 
sexually or gender diverse (LGBT IQA+) populations. There are, however, limitations to 
data in some cases, particularly small population or sample sizes. The Government is 
committed to ensuring data  is available to help inform better outcomes for all Australians, 
noting this needs to be culturally appropriate and protect the right to privacy.  
This Statement uses unit record data from the Household, Income and Labour  Dynamics  
in Australia (HILDA) Survey. The HILDA Project was initiated and is funded by the 
Australian Government Department of Social Services (DSS) and is managed by the 
Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research (Melbourne Institute). 
The findings a nd views reported in this paper, however, are those of the authors and 
should not be attributed to either DSS or the Melbourne Institute.  
The majority of the data collected and reported in this Statement relate to sex, not gender. 
Sex is based upon the person ’s sex characteristics, such as their chromosomes, hormones 
and reproductive organs . Gender  is a social and cultural concept. It is about social and 
cultural differences in identity, expression and experience as a man, woman or 
non-binary  person. This Statement uses the terms women  and men in reference to both 
sex and gender.

Foreword  
Equality for women has been a priority of the Albanese Government since day one. We are 
the first majority -woman Federal Government in Australia ’s history, we have the first 
gender equal Cabinet, and every single member of the Government is committed to making 
life better for women. Because we know that when women have fair opportunities, are 
treated equally , have access to health  care and are safe, we grow our workforce, lift our 
living standards, boost productivity, and maximise the talent and capa bility  we need to 
build Australia ’s future.  
We know that shifting the dial for women ’s equality requires effort across the board. This is 
reflected in Working for Women: A Strategy for Gender Equality  (Working for Women ), which 
outlines a ten-year plan for investing in gender equality across five priority areas: 
gender -based violence; unpaid and paid care; economic equality and security; health; and 
leadership, representation and decision -making.  
These areas have been a focus for the Albanese Government since our first budget, and in 
making women ’s equality a core economic imperative, we have been able to focus across 
portfolios and across every budget on actions that work together to drive gender equality. 
The Women ’s Budget Statement reports on progress in implementing Working for Women  
by highlighting Government decisions and investments to achieve gender equality 
year  on year.  
One year into Working for Women , the Government is continuing to take action to improve 
the lives of women in Australia and we are seeing progress. Under our Government, the 
national gender pay gap has fallen to 11.9  per cent as of  November  2024  – down from 
14.1 per cent in  May  2022. In this same time period, women ’s full -time average weekly 
ordinary time earnings have grown by $217.40 a week, helping women to better deal with 
cost-of-living pressures and build their lifelong economic security. The Governme nt’s tax 
cuts for every taxpayer are also designed to make it easier for women to work more and 
keep more of what they earn. And we have reached  record highs for women ’s workforce 
participation  in 2025 .  
The Government ’s workplace relations reforms, investments in cheaper early childhood 
education and care, and expansion of the Paid Parental Leave scheme are having an impact. 
But there is more to do. While narrowing, the gender pay gap persists – a reflection of 
challenges related to care and flexibility, industry gender segregation , women ’s 
under -representation in senior roles and discrimination. Women continue to carry the 
larger share of unpaid work, impacting their financial security, including into retirement. 
And most importantly, women must – and deserve to – be safe.  
Our priority is ensuring women and children  are free from violence and abuse in their 
homes, workplaces , communities  and online . Since  the 2022 –23 October Budget, we have 
invested over $4 billion in initiatives to support women ’s safety and deliver the National 
Plan to End Violence against Women and Children 2022 –2032. In the second half of 2024, the 
Rapid Review of Prevention Approaches  informed a national package of investments to 
help end the scourge of violence against women and children in this country . We extended   
 
 | Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 2 | Foreword  
the National Partnership Agreement on Family, Domestic and Sexual Violence Responses  
to support frontline service delivery  and provided funding to strengthen responses to 
high -risk and serial perpetrators , support  children and young people , and invested in 
initiatives  to help break the cycle of violence. In addition, w e are supporting  frontline legal 
assistance services  through a new $3.9 billion National Access to Justice Partnership with 
the states and territories, which includes a focus on uplifting services that respond to 
gender -based violence and provid ing culturally safe legal assistance to Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander  people.  
Everyone should feel safe and supported in higher education settings . From 
1 February  2025, we established the National Student Ombudsman, which has powers to 
investigate student complaints and resolve disputes with higher education providers , 
including complaints about sexual assault, sexual harassment and all gender -based 
violence.  We have also made significant reforms to increase women ’s safety at work, 
including to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace.  
We are building on those reforms with investments in this Budget to improve justice 
responses for victim -survivors of sexual violence and address domestic, family and sexual 
violence against First Nations women.  
Our Government is committed to listening to and working in genuine partnership with 
Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander women, families and communities. We have 
responded to the Senate Inquiry into missing and murdered First  Nations women and 
children , which is informing our work to end violence against First  Nations women. 
National Cabinet also committed to maintain a central focus on missing and murdered 
First  Nations women and agreed all government commitments on gender -based violence 
must explicitly consider the needs and experiences of First  Nations people and be delivered 
in genuine partnership with First  Nations communities.  
We will continue to work through National Cabinet and in close collaboration with state 
and territory governments to ensure  a nationally coordinated approach to ending 
gender -based violence.  
Low wages in the female -dominated care and support economy drives the gender pay gap 
and a lack of affordable early childhood education and care is a barrier to families working 
the way they want. From  January  2026, under the 3 Day Guarantee , families will be eligible 
for at least 72 hours of Child Care Subsidy  each fortnight for early childhood education and 
care regardless of activity levels, with 100  subsidised hours per fortnight for families caring 
for a First  Nations child.  The $1  billion Building Ear ly Education Fund will build more 
early childhood education and care centres and expand services in areas of need, including 
in the outer suburbs and regional Australia. We are delivering a phased 15  per cent wage 
increase for eligible early childhood education and care workers over two  years from  
December  2024, which will help retain existing early childhood educators and attract new 
employees to this sector. These investments help address the undervaluation of this critical 
female -dominated workforce and  will make early childhood education and care  more 
affordable and accessible so that families have more choices .  Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Foreword  | Page 3 
The Australian labour market remains highly gender -segregated by industry and 
occupation , which may  impact skills shortages in key workforces and contribute to the 
gender pay gap. We are working to promote greater gender balance and opportunities 
through our investments in new and emerging industries. We are implementing our Future 
Made in Australia agenda, including the Community Benefit Principles to promote safe 
and secure jobs and develop more skilled and inclusive workforces, including for women. 
These  principles are consistent with the Government ’s commitment to address the drivers 
of workforce gender segregation to ensure women share in the jobs of the future.  
We recognise that Government cannot solve workforce gender segregation on its own, and 
that is why we are bringing together industry, employers and unions  to drive systemic 
structural and cultural change through a new $16.4  million tripartite pilot grants program. 
We recognise that Government cannot solve workforce gender segregation on its own, and 
that is why we are bringing together industry, employers  and unions to drive systemic 
structural and cultural change through a new $16.4  million tripartite pilot grants program. 
The program will create partnerships with peak employer organisations and state and 
territory Trades and Labour Councils who are uniquely placed to help identify new ways 
to make workplaces safer, more respectful and more equitable for women in traditional ly 
male -dominated sectors.  
Our Government has made deliberate structural reforms to close gender gaps in the 
workplace. We made gender equality a central objective of the Fair Work Act 2009 , 
introduced ten days of paid family and domestic violence leave for all 12.4 million workers, 
and funded wage increases in aged care and early childhood education and care  – two 
undervalued female -dominated sectors facing labour shortages . The data collected by the 
Workplace Gender Equality Agency allows us to track progress and increase transpare ncy 
on workplace gender equality. We are now in the second year of reporting the gender pay 
gaps of private sector employers with more than 100 employees, bringing focus to how  – 
and if  – businesses are working to advance equality within their own workplaces. Pay gaps 
for public sector employers will be published for the first time in the first half of 2025.  
We know that increasing accountability and raising the bar for large employers helps drive 
action and progress. We have introduced the Workplace Gender Equality Amendment 
(Setting Gender Equality Targets) Bill  2024 , which will introduce a world -first targets 
scheme to accelerate action on gender equality by large Australian employers. It will 
require organisations with 500 or more employees in Australia to commit to achieve  – or, 
at a minimum, improve on  – measurable targets to progress gender equality in their 
workplaces. Targets will lead to more ambitious commitment and progress, driving 
workplace gender equality in Australia.  
The Albanese Government recognises that women have specific and varied  health needs 
and often face higher health costs and health care not targeted to these needs . We have 
listened to women and the advice of experts and are taking action to address long -standing 
gaps in our healthcare  system. This Budget invests $ 792.9  million over five years from 
2024 –25 to deliver more choice, lower costs , and better care  for women . This includes the 
first Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listing s for new oral contraceptive pills in mor e than 
30 years and the first listing for new menopausal hormone therapies in over 20  years. This 
package  will increase  Medicare rebates and enable more bulk billing for the insertion and

removal of long -acting reversible contraceptives , help deliver new endometriosis and 
pelvic pain clinics, and support women experiencing menopause. These changes will 
improve access and provide critical cost -of-living relief by saving some women thousands 
of dollars across their lifetimes.  
Since our Government  reintroduc ed gender responsive budgeting  in 2022 , gender analysis 
and policy alignment with the five priorities of Working for Wom en have become a core 
element of Government decision -making. With more women in this Government ’s Cabinet 
than ever before, we are ensuring policies work towards gender equality and encourage 
women ’s participation in decision -making and leadership.   
Our investments  in this Budget are a continuation of our work to advance gender equality 
since we came to Government, with reforms continuing to come online – superannuation 
will be paid on Government -funded  Paid Parental Leave for babies born or adopted on or 
after 1  July 2025 and will expand to six months from  July 2026.  Our expansion of the 
Parenting Payment (Single)  and launch of the new Parent  Pathways program in late 2024 
will continue to support vulnerable parents and their children.  We have introduc ed 
legislation to make Free TAFE permanent and Commonwealth Prac Payments start from 
mid-2025, supporting women to invest in their education . Our reforms to HELP and other 
student loans, including limiting indexation and our proposed changes to the repayment 
system and to reduce student debts, will help with the cost of living . We have made 
structural changes and landmark investments to narrow the gender pay gap, increase 
wages in female -dominated workforces, improve the accessibility and affordability of 
critical services like health care and early childhood education and care , and make 
national -level and lasting inves tments to end gender -based violence and keep women safe.  
We have made huge strides forward over the last three years, but we know there is still a 
way to go. For the Albanese Government, women ’s equality is  not an afterthought, it  is 
essential to building Australia ’s future. And we will continue to take this important work 
seriously as we strive to create a better, more equal Australia for everyone.

conditions, with higher health care 
demand and out -of-pocket costs  
Women also have complex sexual and 
reproductive health conditions that have 
been underfunded and under researched  
More choice, lower costs and better 
health care for women:  
• Improved contraceptive choice and 
affordability  
• Cheaper and enhanced menopause

Gender -based violence  
Key statistics  
In 2024, on average, one woman 
was killed every ten days by a current  or 
former intimate partner  Around one in four women (2.3  million 
women) and one  in 14 men (693,000 
men) have  experienced physical and/or 
sexual violence from an intimate partner 
since the age of 15  
In 2022 –23, First Nations women 
were  34 times more likely to be 
hospitalised due to family violence than 
non-Indigenous women  Between 39% and 55% of domestic 
violence offenders had a prior history of 
violence towards an intimate  partner  
Around one in five women have 
experienced sexual violence since the 
age of 15, and were over three times 
more likely to have experienced it from a 
man they knew than a stranger  99.3% of family, domestic and 
sexual  violence practitioners  reported 
they had clients who experienced 
technology facilitated abuse  and 
domestic violence  
These statistics are not just numbers – they represent real women, children and individuals 
in Australian communities who have experienced inexcusable violence. Everyone has a 
right to live free from fear and violence. Achieving this requires accelerated, collective 
action to prevent gender -based violence and support those who have experienced or are 
experiencing violence.  
Female  intimate partner homicides have declined over time since the collection of data on 
such incidents began, with 37 incidents in 2024 compared to 60 incidents in 1989 –90.1  
However, each one of these deaths is still one too many, underscoring the urgency of a 
continued whole of community response to this national crisis.  
Ending gender -based violence  
Ending the national crisis of gender -based violence requires persistent and coordinated 
action at all levels, with victim -survivors at the heart of all solutions. All governments have 
made a collective commitment to achieve the vision of ending gender -based violence in one 
generation under the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children 2022 –2032 
(National Plan). As the overarching policy framework, the National Plan emphasises that  
 
 | Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 10 | Gender -based violence  
breaking this cycle of violence must occur across the four domains of prevention, early 
intervention, response, and recovery and healing. As outlined in Working  for Women , 
gender equality cannot be achieved without ending gender -based violence.  
The Government has now invested over $4 billion in women ’s safety and delivering the 
National Plan since its launch in 2022. Recent Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 
National Plan Outcomes reporting data also demonstrates that progress is being made, 
including a shift in community understanding and attitudes towards violence against 
women and gender equality.  
With  First Nations  women continuing to be disproportionately impacted by gender -based 
violence, all commitments across governments to end violence against women and children 
must maintain a sustained focus on First Nations women and children. Building on the 
National Plan, the forthcoming Our Ways – Strong Ways – Our Voices: National Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander Plan to End Family, Domestic and Sexual Violence , will guide a 
whole -of-society approach to addressing the unacceptable rates of violence against 
First  Nations women and children.  
However, the National Plan ’s objectives can only be achieved through persistent and 
coordinated action across all sectors and levels of government. To build on the substantial 
efforts already underway to ensure women and children are safe, the Prime Minister 
convened two National Cabinet meetings in 2024 to agree on additional practical and 
targeted steps to end gender -based violence within a generation.  
The first National Cabinet meeting on 1 May 2024 agreed priority reform areas for all 
governments as: increasing accountability and consequences for perpetrators ; 
strengthening prevention efforts through targeted and evidenced -based approaches ; 
focusing on missing and murdered First Nations women and children ; and the impact of 
family and domestic violence on First Nations communities.  
The Government subsequently commissioned an expert panel to undertake a 
Rapid  Review  of Prevention Approaches (Rapid Review). Since its release on 
23 August  2024, the Rapid  Review report, Unlocking the Prevention Potential: Accelerating 
Action to End Domestic, Family, and Sexual Violence,  has been and will continue to be critical 
in informing future reform. With a focus on breaking the cycle of violence  and preventing it 
before it starts , the Rapid Review ’s recommendations target areas such as responding to 
children and young people ’s experiences of violence, engaging men and boys in 
prevention  efforts, and understanding the pathways to perpetration to better direct 
early  intervention  strategies.  
To maintain the momentum of this national call to action, a second National Cabinet 
meeting was convened on 6  September  2024. This meeting saw all governments agree to a 
comprehensive package that harnesses  further  important opportunities to work together to 
prevent violence and support frontline  services.  
 Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Gender -based violence  | Page 11 
MYEFO highlights: National Cabinet investment to address gender -based 
violence  
The Government provided $534.5  million over six years from 2024 –25 to address the 
national crisis of gender -based violence and support the delivery of National 
Cabinet priorities endorsed on  6 September  2024. Highlights include:  
• $366.9  million over five years from 2025 –26 to extend the National Partnership 
Agreement on Family, Domestic and Sexual Violence Responses , which will 
include matched funding by states and territories, and support greater flexibility 
for jurisdictions to direct funding to meet local need. This funding is now 
indexed and will be accompanied by stronger transparency and accountability 
mechanisms. It will also include a focus on supporting prevention activities 
through frontline services, including specialist services for women; services to 
support children exposed to family, domestic and sexual violence to heal and 
recove r; and working with men, including men ’s behaviour change programs for 
perpetrators of gendered violence  
• $82.4  million over four years from 2024 –25 to strengthen responses to high -risk 
and serial perpetrators of family and domestic violence (see MYEFO highlights : 
Responding to high ‑risk and serial perpetrators  for further detail ) 
• $81.3  million over six years from 2024 –25 to enhance and expand child centric 
trauma informed supports for children and young people, and design and 
implement new and revised initiatives for children and young people with 
experiences of violence (see MYEFO highlights:  Support for children and young 
people who have experienced violence  for further detail ). 
This investment also includes funding to break the cycle of violence and prevent 
further harm by developing national standards for men ’s behaviour change, 
updating the National framework for action to prevent alcohol -related family violence  and 
conducting an audit of Commonwealth systems to identify where they are 
weaponised by perpetrators of family and domestic violence .  
The Government ’s investment is in addition to funding committed in 2024 –25 
MYEFO for legal assistance and builds on ongoing commitments in housing for 
women and children escaping violence and improved financial security for women  
 
Preventing violence against women and children  
Preventing violence before it starts is critical to ending gender -based violence. Prevention 
requires a collective national effort, where individuals, communities, organisations and all 
levels of government work collaboratively to address the underlying drivers of 
gender -based violence. This includes challenging harmful attitudes and stereotypes that 
condone violence against women , embedding activities across sectors to prevent and 
respond early to gender -based violence  and supporting children who have experienced 
violence to heal and recover, and break the cycle of violence .   
 
 | Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 12 | Gender -based violence  
The Government is building on efforts to prevent gender -based violence through consent 
education and support for children and young people, in addition to providing further 
funding for prevention and early intervention initiatives for First Nations women and 
children. These steps also help action the Rapid Revi ew recommendation that all levels of 
government should expand their approach to prevention, leverage all prevention 
touchpoints more effectively and identify where abuse can be prevented.  
Promoting healthy relationships and consent  
Improving community awareness and attitudes on consent and respectful relationships is 
vital to reducing sexual violence. Evidence highlights the importance of teaching young 
people about consent in an age -appropriate way during their early years and adolescence, 
helping them develop skills for respectful relationships and reducing harm.   
The Consent Policy Framework: Promoting healthy sexual relationships and consent 
among young people lays the foundation for preventing sexual violence and promoting 
healthy relationships by equipping organisations with a clear understanding of consent and 
ways to address the underlying gendered drivers of sexual violence. A range of 
investments in consent education have been made to support young people having healthy 
relationships, including $3.5  million for Teach Us Consent to expand its work on sexual 
violence and consent, particularly targeting young people aged 16  years and above.  
In 2024, the Government signed a $77.6  million Federation Funding Agreement Schedule 
with all state s and terr itories , through which the Government is providing funding to 
states, territories and the non -government school sector to support their delivery of 
Consent and Respectful Relationships Education across government and non -government 
primary and secondary schools in school years 2024 –2028. This is bolstered by the 
Government ’s $40  million Consent Can ’t Wait  campaign, which was informed by extensive 
developmental research with more than 2,600  Australians, and alongside consultation 
with  a panel of sexual violence and consent experts. Since the  campaign ’s launch, 
www.consent.gov.au  has received more than 5 31,000 page views from more than 
472,000 users .  
Supporting children and young people affected by violence  
Children and young people also experience and are profoundly impacted by violence. 
Exposure to family, domestic and sexual violence can affect their behaviour, schooling, 
cognitive development, and overall mental and physical wellbeing. With evidence showing 
children who experience family, domestic and sexual violence are more likely themselves 
to use violence or become victim -survivors as adults, supporting young children is 
critical  prevention work to break the cycle of violence.  
In delivering the National Plan and the Rapid Review ’s recommendation to elevate and 
embed the distinct experiences of children and young people as victim -survivors, the 
Government has funded a package of initial measures enabling immediate action while it 
undertakes a comprehensive consultation process to inform the design and implementation 
of new and revised initiatives that support children and young people.  This work builds on Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Gender -based violence  | Page 13 
existing investments for children and young people, including funding for the Helping 
Children Heal program which provides specialist support for children aged 6  to 12 to 
mitigate the impacts of violence, and establishing a National Commission for Aboriginal 
and Torres Islander Children and Young People, which commenced in January 2025 and is 
dedicated to promoting the rights, interests and wellbeing of First Nations children and 
young people . 
MYEFO highlights: Support for children and young people who have 
experienced violence  
In response to National Cabinet priorities, the Government is investing $81.3  million 
over six years from 2024 –25 for additional initiatives to support children and young 
people who have experienced family, domestic and sexual violence. This includes:  
• $1.0 million over two years from 2024 –25 for a comprehensive consultation 
process to inform the design and implementation of new and revised initiatives 
and interventions to support children and young people, including a specific 
focus on First Nations children and young people  
• $40.6 million over six years from 2024 –25 (and $10.7  million per year ongoing 
from 2030 –31) for expansion of the Children Specific Counselling components in 
the Specialised Family Violence Service program  
• $20.1 million over six years from 2024 –25 (and $5.6  million per year ongoing from 
2030 –31) to expand and extend funding to Aboriginal Community Controlled 
Organisations to provide culturally safe child -centred support to First Nations 
children and young people and their families under the Specialised Family 
Violence Service program  
• $12.8  million over five years from 2024 –25 for a targeted grants program for 
specialist and community support services to enhance and expand services to 
support victim -survivors of child sexual abuse and young people who are at risk 
of harmful sexual behaviours   
• $6.8 million over three years from 2024 –25 to expand the Supporting Children 
After Separation Program to provide access to specialised, longer -term support 
for children of separated or separating families affected by family violence . 
 
Working with men and boys  
The Rapid Review identified that working with men and boys is critical to breaking the 
cycle of violence and supporting all Australians to be in safe, equal and positive 
relationships. Nearly 20  per cent of young Australian men believe that it is legitimate to 
violently resist feminism, and nearly 10  per cent find it understandable that young men 
who are rejected by women resort to violent vengeance.2  
 
 | Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 14 | Gender -based violence  
Online platforms are playing an increasing role in the information men and boys receive 
and can have a dangerous influence over how they consider their role in the community. In 
addition, some young men may experience violence in their own families and sho uld be 
supported to recover and heal so they are empowered to break cycles of violence and men 
who seek support for their own violence must be helped to change their behaviour.  
To support  the National Plan, the Government is implementing a range of initiatives 
targeted at supporting men and boys, in turn helping to prevent gender -based violence. 
This includes $34.8 million  in project funding  for an early intervention  trial which provide 
counselling and therapeutic support for young men and boys with adverse childhood 
experiences and family, domestic or sexual violence risk , and $3.5  million in project 
funding for trials by the Man Cave, The Men ’s Project (Jesuit Social Services) and for a 
consortium of providers led by the Foundation for Positive Masculinity to encourage 
healthy, respectful relationships among school -aged boys.   
Funding has also been provided to No to Violence and MensLine Changing for Good 
Program for counselling and support services and referral information for men who use 
violence. Since the 2022 –23 October Budget, over $15  million  has been invested in 
counselling and support services and referral information  for men who use violence , which 
complement state and territory men ’s behaviour change programs. To ensure that First 
Nations men can access education programs , therapies and  activities  to reconnect with 
culture and community  and reduce family and domestic violence , 13 Men ’s Wellness 
centres in First Nations communities are also being delivered across the country.  
Preventing violence against First  Nations women and children  
Given the disproportionately high rates and severity of violence experienced by First 
Nations women and children, prevention approaches must consider the unique underlying 
causes of this violence. This includes ongoing impacts of colonisation, intergenerat ional 
trauma, and systemic and institutional racism.  
The Senate Inquiry into Missing and Murdered First Nations Women and Children report, 
published on 15  August  2024, highlights the extent of this violence and the need for a 
tailored approach led by First Nations communities. The Inquiry will inform work 
currently underway through the National Plan and the National Agreement on Closing the 
Gap, including the devel opment of the Our Ways – Strong Ways – Our Voices , which  will be 
grounded in self -determination, including people with lived experience and 
First  Nations -led implementation. Building on initiatives in Australia ’s first dedicated 
Aboriginal and Torres Strai t Islander Action Plan 2023 –2025 under the National Plan, 
Our Ways – Strong Ways – Our Voices , will continue the Government ’s commitment to 
protecting First Nations women, children and families to be free of all forms of violence.  
Investment in this Budget builds on the over $370  million invested to address  violence 
against First Nations women and children since the 2022 –23 October  Budget. This includes 
funding for healing and recovery, such as the expansion of the Healing for Families 
initiative to 12 locations across Australia, which provides culturally -based and 
trauma -informed healing support such as counselling and therapy, financial support 
and advice and investments in support services including funding for Family Violence 
Prevention Legal Services providers to deliver supports for First Nations victim -survivors.   Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Gender -based violence  | Page 15 
Budget highlight: Delivering prevention, early intervention and response 
services for First  Nations communities  
The Government is continuing to deliver actions under the Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander Action Plan 2023 –2025 by committing $21.8  million over two years 
from  2025 –26. This funding will continue the successful delivery of critical 
prevention, early intervention and response services to address family, domestic, 
and sexual violence in high needs First Nations communities. Services are 
community -led, trauma informed and culturally safe and provide practical 
intervention for First Nations peoples at -risk of experiencing or using violence.   
 
A frontline response to gender -based violence  
In parallel with work on prevention approaches which have a long -term impact, 
strengthening frontline supports provides victim -survivors with the immediate services 
needed to escape violence. Impacts of gender -based violence can be wide -ranging, affecting 
a person ’s emotional and social wellbeing, employment and financial security. Without the 
financial resources to survive, a safe place to stay, and the support in navigating the legal 
system, many women and children remain trapped in cycles of violence. Comprehensi ve 
and coordinated frontline response systems are essential for keeping women and children 
safe, reducing the reoccurrence of violenc e and holding perpetrators to account.  
Increasing national funding for specialist frontline services  
Specialist frontline services play a critical role in ensuring victim -survivors are empowered 
to leave violent situations and are supported through long -term recovery. Specialist 
services providers report they are struggling to keep up with demand and escalating risk, 
and at times are unable to respond to victim -survivors. Bolstering  frontline response 
systems to include targeted funding will ensure needed support is provided and promotes 
healing and recovery for victim -survivors, including First Nations wo men and children at 
greatest risk.  
The Government has reaffirmed its commitment to end gend er-based violence through the 
renewed, five -year National Partnership Agreement on Family, Domestic and Sexual 
Violence Responses  (the Agreement) which will commence on 1  July 2025 . The Agreement  
will provide increased funding to support  critical frontline services . The Government has 
worked quickly with states and territories , with  all jurisdictions now signed up to the 
new  Agreement, ensuring critical funding certainty for the frontline service sector . 
The Agreement  delivers on National Cabinet ’s commitment o f 6 September  2024 and the 
Rapid  Review recommendation to address factors that exacerbate violence against wome n 
and children .

Page 16 | Gender -based violence  
Increased funding for frontline legal services  
Free, holistic, trauma -informed legal and related services provide crucial support to women 
to leave violent and abusive relationships, navigate the justice system, and recover and 
achieve economic security. Half of all services provided by Community Legal Centres in 
2023 went t o victim -survivors of family and domestic violence, and 86 per cent of all family 
law grants provided by Legal Aid Commissions involved allegations of family and 
domestic violence.  
The National Access to Justice Partnership (NAJP) announced  following the 
6 September  2024 National Cabinet meeting, includes new quarantined funding streams for 
Women ’s Legal Services and Family Violence Prevention Legal Services. These services 
support legal assistance for women, including legal representation, support and advocacy, 
as well as culturally safe wraparound services to First Nations victims and survivors 
experienc ing, at risk of and recovering from , family, domestic and sexual violence.  
Gender analysis in practice: National Access to Justice Partnership  
The $3.9 billion NAJP will have a positive impact on gender equality by assisting 
women escaping gender -based violence, through increasing essential frontline legal 
services and providing targeted support for women most at risk, particularly First 
Nations women.  
The NAJP will provide $833  million over five years to Community Legal Centres, 
with $275.7  million specifically for Women ’s Legal Services and $366.8 million for 
Family Violence Prevention Legal Services. This funding will increase frontline 
specialist legal assistance to prevent and respond to the gender -based violence crisis, 
helping to keep women and children safe and accelerating the Government ’s efforts 
to end family, domestic and sexual violence in one generation.  
Funding will also help to address pay disparity within the legal assistance sector by 
narrowing the gap between the female -dominated community legal sector and Legal 
Aid Commissions. In the community legal sector, 70  per cent of legal practitioners 
identify as female, with this increasing to between 80  per cent to 90 per cent for 
Family Violence Prevention Legal Services employees. In the Independent Review of 
the National Legal Assistance Partnership, submissions pointed to the median 
income for community legal sector employees being 15 -20 per cent lower than their 
counterparts at Legal Aid Commissions.3 The NAJP will see the Commonwealth, 
states and territories develop, in consultation with the legal assistance sector, a 
workforce strategy, including examining the extent of pay disparity within the legal 
assistance sector, the reduction in pay disparity over time  and the effect on supply 
and demand for a skilled legal assistance workforce. The Government has 
committed ongoing funding beyond the five -year life of the NAJP which will 
provide greater stability and financial certainty for the sector and workforce.

Delivering support for remote First  Nations communities in the 
Northern  Territory  
First Nations people face unique barriers in accessing formal support with estimates 
suggesting that around 90  per cent of violence against First Nations women is undisclosed. 
These challenges, including a lack of access to transportation and communication channels, 
are compounded for First Nations women and children living in remote communities.  
The Government delivers support for critical services in remote First Nations communities 
in the Northern Territory through the Northern Territory Remote Aboriginal Investment. 
This covers remote policing, child and family services, Aboriginal interpreter services, 
alcohol harm reduction services, and education programs. In February 2025, the 
Government signed a new Partnership Agreement to strengthen remote services in 
the Northern Territory.  
Budget highlight: Northern Territory Remote Aboriginal Investment  
The Government is investing $842.6  million over six years from 2025 –26 to deliver 
the Northern Territory Remote Aboriginal Investment, in partnership with the 
Northern Territory Government and the Aboriginal Peak Organisations Northern 
Territory. This funding includes investment for critical services and infrastructure 
that support the safety and wellbeing of First Nations women, children and families.  
It includes new investment in Aboriginal Community Controlled Children and 
Family Centres to enable First Nations women and communities to determine their 
own solutions to complex issues, recognising First Nations communities ’ strengths 
and knowledge of what is required to improve the safety and wellbeing of 
First  Nations families. As a result, services for First Nations women and families 
will be better targeted and more culturally responsive in the future.  
To address the higher rates of family and domestic violence in the 
Northern  Territory, there will also be additional funding for remote policing, 
women ’s safety, and community development and mediation initiatives.   
 
Housing security for women in crisis  
Family and domestic violence is the leading cause of homelessness for women and 
children, with 45 per cent of all women and girls seeking homelessness assistance 
identifying family and domestic violence as a cause.  
Delivery of crisis, transitional, social and affordable housing for vulnerable Australians, 
including women and children impacted by violence, continues through initiatives such as  
the recently launched $1  billion National Housing Infrastructure Facility – Crisis and 
Transitional Housing, the $100  million Crisis and Transitional Accommodation Program  
under the Housing Australia Future Fund , and the $9.3  billion provided under National 
Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness. In February 2025, the Gover nment  
 
 | Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 18 | Gender -based violence  
announced that as part of the Crisis and Transitional Accommodation Program, 42  projects 
across Australia will be offered funding totalling $100  million to build new crisis and 
transitional homes for women and children experiencing family and domestic violence, and 
older women at risk of homelessness. Together, these investments are helping to reduce the 
strain on the crisis accommodation system, reduce unmet need for transitional housing, 
and strengthen pathways into longer -term housing.  
Budget highlight s: Frontline crisis accommodation  
Funding of $2.5  million in 2025 –26 will be reallocated to extend the Safe Places 
Emergency Accommodation Program and support the completion of three projects.  
The Safe Places Program provides capital works grants to support the renovation, 
building or purchase of new emergency accommodation for women and children 
experiencing family and domestic violence. The Safe Places program has already 
been provided funding  of $172.6  million and when completed will support 
around  1,500 safe places for women and children experiencing family and 
domestic  violence . 
 
Empowering people to leave violent relationships through financial 
support packages  
Financial insecurity is another major barrier for women escaping violence, often driving 
them to remain with, or return to, an abusive partner. To help overcome this, the 
Government has committed $925.2  million to establish the new and permanent Leaving 
Violence Program, which will commence on 1  July 2025. This program will provide critical 
support to victim -survivors of intimate partner violence, including migrants regardless 
of visa status, through individualised financial support packages of up to $5,000  which will 
be indexed annually to keep pace with the cost of living. Those eligible will also have access 
to safety planning, risk assessments, and short -term referral support services for up to 
12 weeks. The Leaving Violence Program is expected to provide financial support packages 
to approximately 36,000 victim -survivors each year.  
This program builds on the successes and learnings from the Escaping Violence Payment 
trial and the Temporary Visa Holders Experiencing Violence Pilot, providing certainty for 
victim -survivors, service providers and the broader family, domestic  and sexual 
violence  sector.  
Strengthening systems responses to violence  
Supporting frontline services is a vital part of the fight against the gender -based violence 
crisis. However, broader structural changes are required to drive lasting change across the 
private and public sectors, including justice, government and financial systems, to ensure 
systems can protect the women and children who rely on the m. Perpetrators can misuse 
and exploit weaknesses within systems to inflict abuse, worsen coercive control, and Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Gender -based violence  | Page 19 
deepen trauma for victim -survivors. Address ing the design of  systems which enable such 
abuse can drive reform and enhance efforts to stop violence before it starts.  
Improving justice system responses to sexual violence  
Women who have experienced sexual violence should be properly supported to engage 
with the justice system when they seek help, and the system should minimise the extent of 
any re -traumatisation. One in five women in Australia have experienced sexual violence 
since the age of 15, however, only 13  per cent of these women reported their most recent 
assault to the police.4 For women who do report, justice is rarely obtained as attrition rates 
are high, prosecution rates are low, and conviction rates are even lower.   
The Government is committed to ensuring the justice system supports victim -survivors to 
access justice , including strengthening legal frameworks  and justice sector capability , and 
supporting research and greater collaboration. To inform work to strengthen legal 
frameworks and protections for victim -survivors, the Government has delivered a national 
review and comparative analysis of sexual assault and child sexual abuse legislation across 
Australia. A national education resource for the justice sector was also released , presenting 
evidence -based insights into the realities of sexual assault and suggest ing approaches to 
counteract the inappropriate influence that false assumptions and stereotypes can have in 
the justice system.  
In December 2024, the Government passed  the Crimes Amendment (Strengthening the 
Criminal Justice Response to Sexual Violence) Act 2024  to ensure additional protections are 
provided for vulnerable people , including victim -survivors, when appearing as witnesses  
in Commonwealth criminal  proceedings. The legislation will  provide greater support to 
vulnerable people , minim ising the risk of re -traumatisation for witnesses  through 
mechanisms such as evidence recording hearings, and  ensur ing victim -survivors  can sp eak 
out about their experiences publicly should they wish to do so.  
These changes complement the $ 14.7 million provided in the 2023 –24 Budget to strengthen 
the way the criminal justice system responds to sexual assault  and prevent harm , including 
to establish the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) Inquiry into Justice Responses 
to Sexual Violence. On 22  January 2025, the ALRC provided Government with its report  
which found that the justice system is failing to meet the twin goals of access to justice and 
perpetrator accountability. As an immediate first step in respons e to this important report, 
investments in this Budget will address barriers to justice for victim -survivors of 
sexual  violence.  
Recognising the role of health services in responding to victim -survivors, the Government 
has also expanded an existing family and domestic violence pilot to provide increased 
support to primary care providers to assist victim -survivors of family, domestic and sexual 
violence. There is now a  Supporting the Primary Care response to Family, Domestic and 
Sexual Violence Primary Health Network  Pilot establish ed in every state and territory . This 
will help  increase skills of staff in primary care to better ident ify, care for and refer people 
who have experienced sexual violence and child sexual abuse, as well as family and 
domestic violence.

Budget highlights: Strengthening Justice System Responses to Sexual 
Violence  
The Government is committing $21.4  million over three years from 2025 –26 for 
immediate, targeted measures to improve victim and survivor engagement with the 
justice system and inform a broader response to the ALRC Inquiry into Justice 
System Responses to Sexual Violence. This package includes $19.6  million to extend 
the current specialised trauma informed sexual assault legal services pilots in 
Victoria, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory and expand the 
pilots to other jurisdictions. The pilots will include trialling new non -legal support 
services recommended by the ALRC, including culturally safe justice  system 
navigators and supporting access to restorative justice pathways. Funding of 
$0.6 million is also being provided for targeted research to understand systemic 
issues related to withdrawal of complaints and police accountability.  
$1.2 million over two years from 2025 –26 is being provided to extend and expand 
the scope of the lived experience Expert  Advisory Group and support engagement 
with a range of sectorial stakeholders and experts to provide advice on  further 
implementation  the ALRC ’s recommendations.  
The ALRC ’s report makes clear that reform is complex and will take careful 
consideration . The Government is carefully considering the report ’s 
recommendations and will work closely with states and territories, experts and 
people with lived experience through the Expert Advisory Group to consider a 
longer -term response . 
 
Improving family law responses to violence  
Risk of f amily violence is present in  more than  80 per cent of parenting matters before 
family courts. For many victim -survivors, family law processes can be used to enact further 
harm and can leave them  traumatised . To improve the experience of victim -survivors in the 
family law systems, the Government has legislated a range of significant reforms since the 
2022 –23 October Budget . 
Reforms  contained in the Family Law Amendment Act 2023 and the Family Law Amendment 
(Information Sharing) Act 2023  came into effect in May 2024. These important reforms make 
Australia ’s family law system simpler, safer and easier for separating families and their 
children. Significantly, the law is now much clearer that when resolving  parenting 
disputes , what is in the best interests of the child  should always be  the central focus .  
  Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Gender -based violence  | Page 21 
From 10 June 2025, significant  reforms  to the Family Law Act 1975 will take effect and will 
focus on the financial and property aspects of relationship breakdown including by 
ensuring women who are victim -surviv ors of family violence are able to achieve a fair 
division of property  after se paration. The reforms will enabl e family law courts to consider 
the economic impact of family violence and the housing needs of children  when  
determining how property is to be divided . The reforms will also enable family law courts 
to take into account the impact of family violence when considering orders for the 
provision of maintenance.  
MYEFO highlight: Improving access in the Family Law System  
The Government will provide $44.5  million over three years from 2025 –26 
(and  $15.2  million per year ongoing) to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of 
Australia to continue providing family law case management services to improve 
outcomes for vulnerable g roups and victims of family and domestic violence. This 
ongoing funding will ensure the family law system is safe for vulnerable parties and 
children, particularly in circumstances involving family violence and risk of harm . 
 
Innovative systems responses to target perpetrators of family and 
domestic violence  
Prevention efforts and supports for victim -survivors across systems cannot end 
gender -based violence without strong and targeted responses to perpetrators of violence, 
who are overwhelmingly men. Innovative and targeted approaches across systems which 
better identify and manage perpetrators and those at risk of perpetrating are required to 
stop violence and will bolster Government ’s efforts to improve community education on 
consent, especially for men and boys.   
In line with the National Plan, work is underway to better identify high -risk and serial 
perpetrators, share information about them across systems and state boundaries, and 
intervene early to stop violence escalating. The Government has already provided 
$25 million in funding to roll out innovative perpetrator responses . As an  example, this is 
funding intensive case management and holistic support for people held on remand or on a 
short sentence in Tasmania , and in South Australia it is supporting adolescents engaged in 
youth justice who use violence in their intimate partner an d family relationships . 
Investment of $109.9  million in the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission is also 
support ing enhanced collaboration and information sharing through the continued 
integration of state and territory law enforcement agencies into the National Criminal 
Intelligence System. Th ese are examples of the Government ’s action on a whole of system 
response that integrates processes across law enforcement, justice responses and services 
including men ’s behaviour change .  
 
 | Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 22 | Gender -based violence  
MYEFO highlights: Responding to high -risk and serial perpetrators  
The Government is addressing a key priority from the 6  September  2024 National 
Cabinet by committing $82.4  million over four years from 2024 –25 to strengthen 
justice responses to high -risk and serial perpetrators of family and domestic 
violence. This involves:  
• $2.0 million over three years to develop new national best -practice risk 
assessment principles and a model best ‑practice risk assessment framework  
• $0.6 million over two years to improve information sharing across systems and 
jurisdictions  through enhancements to the National Criminal Intelligence System  
• $50.6  million over four years to work with states and territories to expand and 
increase nationally consistent, two -way information sharing between family law 
courts and state and territory courts, child protection, policing and firearms 
agencies  
• $28.6  million over four years to trial two innovative models, Domestic Violence 
Threat Assessment Centres and focused deterrence, which will use 
evidence -based policing to detect, monitor and intervene with high -risk and 
serial domestic violence offenders  
• $0.6 million over two years to conduct critical research on bail, remand, parole 
and sentencing with regard to risk of intimate partner homicide; and improving 
the operation of court ‑mandated behaviour change programs and their 
interaction with justice systems . 
 
Reviewing government and financial systems misused to 
perpetrate  violence  
Around 16  per cent of women in Australia (approximately 1.6  million women) have 
experienced economic abuse  from a current or previous partner . As acknowledged in the 
Rapid Review report, there is growing evidence of perpetrators of family and domestic 
violence attempting to exploit and manipulate government and financial systems to 
control, threaten or harass a current or former partner. This systems abuse is often part 
of a pattern of coercive control and financial abuse, which can cause economic hardship,  
costly and lengthy legal proceedings, and emotional and administrative burdens for victim 
survivors, making it difficult to rebuild their lives after leaving a violent relationship.  
The Government is also undertaking an audit of Commonwealth systems to identify where 
they are being weaponised by perpetrators of family and domestic violence . In addition , 
the Family Law Act 1975  was amended to include ‘economic or financial abuse ’ as an 
example of behaviour that might constitute family violence . It will also introduce 
protections against the misuse or weaponising of health , sexual ass ault and family violence  
information during family law proceedings.  Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Gender -based violence  | Page 23 
MYEFO highlight: Audit of Commonwealth systems  
The Government is conducting an audit of key Commonwealth systems to identify 
areas being weaponised by perpetrators, and how they could be strengthened to 
improve safety. With a focus on the child support, social security and tax systems, 
the audit will i dentify the highest impact interventions and system improvements 
that will make the most difference in protecting and supporting victim survivors of 
gender -based violence and preventing systems abuse, so the systems are safe and 
work as intended for all Au stralians.  
This work complements and builds on the inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint 
Committee on Corporations and Financial Services  into financial abuse delivered in 
December 2024; the Inspector -General of Taxation ’s investigation into i dentification 
and management of financial abuse within the tax system , due in March  2025; and 
reviews into operation of the child support system . 
 
Making online platforms and services safer for women  
Women are more likely to experience ongoing technology -based abuse than men, with 
online systems abuse now happening at scale. Around  three quarters of all women who use 
online dating apps have experienced at least one form of dating app facilitated sexual 
violence, and 57  per cent of women who experienced sexual harassment in the last 
12 months experienced it online. This abuse is often  severe and damaging in its 
psychological impact, leaving women twice as likely (26.3  per cent) to fear for their safety 
compared to men (12.3  per cent).  
Significant advancements continue to be made to improve the online safety of women and 
children. Recognising the risk of technology -based abuse is even higher for First Nations 
women and girls, a $600,000 priority pool is available under the Preventing Tech -based 
Abuse of Women Grants Program  for projects that support  First Nations women . 
The Government has also legislated to strengthen privacy protections for all Australians, 
including women experiencing family and domestic violence. The reforms created a 
statutory tort which will allow women to seek direct redress for serious breaches of their 
privacy, including against perpetrators of family and domestic violence. The reforms also 
create d new criminal offences to outlaw dox xing with serious criminal penalties of up to 
seven years  imprisonment. Doxxing is a form of abuse that can affect all Australians but is 
often used again st women in the context of family and domestic violence.    
 
 | Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 24 | Gender -based violence  
Ensuring safe education and workplaces for women  
Strengthened responses to violence in higher education  
The Government has also enacted significant reforms to improve responses to sexual 
violence in higher education  and to support the Action Plan Addressing Gender -based 
Violence in Higher Education (Action Plan)  agreed with states and territories.  
From 1 February 2025, an independent National Student Ombudsman  has been established  
under this Action Plan,  allowing all higher education students to escalate complaints about 
the actions of their higher education provider, including complaints about sexual 
harassment, assault and violence. The Government has also introduced legislation to 
establish a National Higher Education Code to Prevent and Respond to Gender -based 
Violence, which will set standards and requirements that all higher education providers 
must meet to make students and staff safer.  
Supporting workplace responses to domestic violence  
Family, d omestic  and sexual violence does not just impact women ’s safety and wellbeing 
but can also impact their employment and economic security. Recent research indicates that 
over a third of people who experience partner violence have taken time off work related to 
that violence, and this increases for women who had  children in their care.  
In recognition of this, all eligible employees, regardless of whether they are  full-time, 
part-time or casual, can access ten days of paid family and domestic violence leave. 
This  is an increase from the previous National Employment Standards entitlement of 
five days of unpaid family and domestic violence leave a year. A recent independent 
review found that this leave provision is succeeding in supporting the financial security of 
those escaping or experiencing violence .5 Of those surveyed who had taken paid family 
and domestic violence leave , 91 per cent said it helped them maintain their income. 
Workplace protections have also increased for victim -survivors under the Fair Work Act 
2009 , following the Government ’s change to  prohibit an employer from taking adverse 
action against an employee, or potential employee, because of family and domestic 
violence.  
Preventing sexual harassment at work  
All women have the right to a safe and respectful workplace. Yet too many people still 
experience workplace sexual harassment, with data from 2022 showing that one in three 
Australians had been sexually harassed at work in the last 5 years, and 41 per cent  of 
women had experienced this harassment.  
The Government has been deeply committed to implementing all recommendations of the 
Respect@Work: Sexual Harassment National Inquiry Report.  In 2022, legislation passed to 
implement outstanding recommendations from the Respect@Work  report, which 
importantly introduced a positive duty on employers to take reasonable and proportionate 
measures to eliminate unlawful sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, as far as Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Gender -based violence  | Page 25 
possible. In addition, the Commonwealth undertook further consultation on an appropriate 
cost model for Commonwealth anti -discrimination law and implemented this model 
through legislation passed in September  2024. This finalised the legislative reform required 
to implement all recommendations of the Respect@Work  report.  
As part of the Government ’s Secure Jobs, Better Pay legislation, the Fair Work Act 2009  was 
amended to prohibit sexual harassment in connection with work, including in the 
workplace . These  changes have been in place since March  2023. The Fair Work Commission 
has also been given greater powers to deal with workplace sexual harassment.  
The Government has also worked across the Parliament on implementation of 
recommendations from Set the Standard: Report on the Independent Review into 
Commonwealth  Parliamentary Workplaces.  All recommendations of this report are now 
ongoing or implemented, with the Government establishing the new Independent 
Parliamentary Standards Commission in October 2024. The establishment of the 
Commission  means that the Behaviour Standards for Commonwealth Parliamentary 
Workplaces and Codes of Conduct for parliamentarians and staff can now be 
independently enforced. These Codes recognise that parliamentarians  and their staff have 
a shared responsibility to ensure that Commonwealth parliamentary  workplac es meet the 
highest standards of integrity, dignity, safety and mutual respect . 
Budget highlight: Strengthening reporting of workplace sexual harassment  
This Budget provides $1.4  million in 2025 –26 for the Workplace Gender Equality 
Agency and Australian Public Service Commission to support continued work on 
public sector reporting requirements, including for workplace sexual harassment, 
which supports the continued implementation of Recommendation  43 of the 
Respect@Work  report . Women's Budget Statement  |

Unpaid and paid care makes a substantial contribution to families, the community, and the 
economy, yet it is undervalued. Caregiving remains predominantly performed by women, 
who spend an average of  nine hours more per week on unpaid care than men, and who 
comprise around 85  per cent of the formal care and support economy. Valuing all forms of 
care, both socially and financially, is fundamental to achieving gender equality in Australia. 
In line with Working for Women , the Government is committed to helping families balance 
work and care  responsibilities , and to better valu ing unpaid and paid care and support 
work in Australia.  
Valuing and sharing unpaid care  
Gendered  divisions of paid and unpaid work  are prevalent in the Australian economy  and 
broader society . The economic and social contribution of unpaid work is undervalued 
and may  be less visible due to traditional gender attitudes and stereotypes around women 
and girls being ‘natural ’ caregivers. This unpaid care is not just for children, but also ageing 
parents, other family members , and people with disability.   
 
 | Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 28 | Unpaid and paid care  
The Government funded the ABS to expand the Labour Account to improve estimates on 
the total hours spent on unpaid care and the monetary value  of unpaid care activities . Early 
estimates found the value of unpaid child care to be $55.6  billion in the  June  quarter 2021, 
with women contributing 69  per cent of these services .  
A more even share of care between parents has benefits for women, men, and children. It 
can free up mothers to further participate in the workforce and can give fathers more time 
to spend with their children, with research finding care from both parents is  important for 
childhood development  and has positive health benefits for  fathers . Along with a more 
even distribution of unpaid care, access to early childhood education and care also plays an 
important role in enabling parents – particularly mothers – to choose their preferred 
balance of work and care, while also being important for child development.  
Helping families balance caring responsibilities  and closing the gender pay gap are key 
objectives  of Working for Women . These goals  are deeply intertwined, with one -third of the 
gender pay gap attributable to women taking time out of the workforce to care for family 
and other interruptions in full -time employment.10 Treasury analysis has shown entering 
parenthood has a large and persistent effect on the gender earnings gap, reducing female 
annual earnings by 53  per cent, on average, in the first five  years of parenthood. This 
divergence in earnings following entry into parenthood is often termed the ‘motherhood 
penalty ’ (or ‘child penalty ’) and is driven by reductions in women ’s workforce 
participation, working hours, and wage growth following parenthood. One driver of the 
motherhood penalty could be flow -on consequences from career breaks and requiring 
flexibility in working hours to balance care responsibilities.

Figure 1 shows that following parenthood, conditional on employment, women experience 
a 40 percentage point fall in the likelihood of working full -time days and a similar rise in 
Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Unpaid and paid care  | Page 29 
the likelihood of working part -time or variable days. Over time, women are more likely to 
be employed on a casual basis and to experience underemployment. Women are also less 
likely to change jobs over time, which  may suggest they are restricted from taking up new 
opportunities because of requirements for flexible work. Previous Treasury research has 
shown job -to-job transitions are an important driver of wage growth.11 Figure 1 suggests 
care-related barriers are causing mothers to work fewer hours than they would like 
and may be limiting their job opportunities. The analysis also suggests parenthood appears 
to have no  or only a negligible impact on men ’s employment outcomes.  
While  these trends apply broadly to women with children, caring responsibilities  differ 
markedly based on characteristics such as whether  women  are partnered  or demographic 
factors . In particular , single mothers have lower participation rates than their male 
counterparts and mothers in couple families, with 68  per cent of single mothers employed 
compared with 75  per cent of single fathers and 78  per cent of mothers in couple families 
with dependants. Greater caring responsibilities for some women can also s tem from 
cultural, religious or community expectations. For instance, 61  per cent of First  Nations 
women provide support to someone living outside of their household and nearly 
two-thirds of these women also live in a household with dependent children.12 
Furthermore, for some First  Nations women, caring responsibilities extend to protecting 
and caring for Country, which remains an important part of daily life and practice.13  
It is widely acknowledged that the disproportionate levels of care women provide as 
primary carers have significant impacts on their lifelong economic security. This includes 
negative effects on pay and lifetime earnings, resulting in lower superannuation 
accumulation and higher risks of poverty in older age. Unpaid care can also negatively 
impact women ’s career progression  and representation in leadership roles, especially for 
those who work  part-time and/or flexibly  to manage caring responsibilities.  
Gender stereotypes and expectations also contribute to the imbalance in caring 
responsibilities in families, with women expected to take on most of this work. Men who 
want to take on more care  may  face difficulty or discrimination accessing leave or flexible 
work. Gendered assumptions about parenting can also make it harder for same sex and 
gender non -binary parents to navigate care roles, parenting services and workplace 
entitlements and support.  
More support for working families  
The Government is making it easier for parents to balance caring for their children with 
other parts of their lives and encouraging more equal sharing of caring responsibilities 
between parents. Key reforms include significant investments in Paid Parental Leave (PPL ) 
and early childhood education and care.  
The Government is expanding PPL in a way that addresses the needs of working 
Australian families, provides greater security and flexibility, and empowers the full and 
equal participation of women in the workforce. As part of the Government ’s largest 
expansion to PPL, the scheme will increase to 24 weeks from 1  July 2025 and 26 weeks from 
1 July 2026. In addition to providing families with more leave, the changes also provide  
 
 | Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 30 | Unpaid and paid care  
greater flexibility for families and support more equal sharing of parenting and household 
responsibilities . This is in part  through increasing  the amount of  leave  parents can take 
together  and extending  reserved weeks available for each parent (sole parents  receive  the 
full entitlement ). The Government will also pay superannuation on Government -funded 
PPL for babies born or adopted on or after 1  July 2025.  
Cameos: How the Paid Parental Leave scheme can support parents to 
share care  
Example 1:  Leila and Sam are a couple and their second child is born on 10  July 2025. 
Leila is self -employed and Sam works casually. Both worked more than 330 hours 
over a ten-month period prior to the birth of their child and they meet the 
income  test. 
Prior to the Government ’s changes to the PPL scheme, which took effect from 
1 July 2023, Leila and Sam would have only had access to 18 weeks of Parental Leave 
Pay and two weeks of Dad and Partner Pay. Now, Leila and Sam can share 24  weeks 
of PPL – around $22,000 at current rates . This means Leila and Sam will share an 
extra four weeks of PPL (which equates to over $3,600 at current rates).  
Leila and Sam have decided to share the PPL entitlement equally, with each 
accessing 12 weeks of the payment. Leila plans to use her share of the PPL 
entitlement flexibly by taking a continuous block following the birth of their child 
and then multiple sho rter blocks as she and Sam balance caring for the child and 
their returns to part -time work. Sam and Leila will both receive an additional 
12 per cent of their PPL payments as a contribution to their nominated 
superannuation funds.  
Example 2:  Sofia is a sole parent and her first child is born on 20  July 2025. 
Sofia  works full -time.  
Prior to the changes to the PPL scheme, which took effect from 1  July 2023, Sofia 
would have been entitled to 18 weeks of PPL. From 1  July 2025, Sofia will be 
entitled  to the total 24 weeks of PPL available. This means Sofia will receive an extra 
six weeks of PPL (which equates to around $5,500 at current rates), which she can 
also complement with any employer -funded parental leave . Sofia will also receive 
an additional 12  per cent of her PPL payments as a contribution to her nominated 
superannuation fund.  
 
As well as PPL settings, access to affordable early childhood education and care can 
influence how parents balance work and care . Households often factor the cost of child care  
against the earnings of the mother, a reflection of assumptions that care is primarily the role 
of women and of women ’s lower earnings. For women who are working, the cost of child 
care can be a factor in influencing decisions to work part -time.  
  Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Unpaid and paid care  | Page 31 
Among parents who reported facing a barrier to work or to working more hours  in 
2022 –23, 55 per cent nominated ‘caring for children ’ as their main reason . Among these 
parents, 70  per cent said they preferred to care for their children or their children were too 
young  or old for child care . The remaining 30  per cent nominated child care -related 
barriers, including cost, availability  and quality. If all child care -related barriers were 
reduced, the parents in this group might be able to increase their labour  supply, which 
would see the labour force expand by 143,000 full -time equivalent workers  (noting other 
factors could still  limit labour force participation ).  
Access to early childhood education and care varies across Australia. Figure  2 shows the 
average number of early childhood education and care centres within ten minutes of 
driving time for areas within each Socio -Economic Ind exes for Areas ( SEIFA ) decile. 
SEIFA  deciles show the socio -economic status of an area, with lower decile values being 
more disadvantaged and less advantaged areas . Families living in higher SEIFA deciles 
have greater choice of early childhood education and care centres. On average, the number 
of centres within ten minutes driving time almost doubles between the  least and most 
advantaged areas.

The Government is committed to building a universal early childhood education and care 
system that is simple and affordable for every family. In the 2024 –25 MYEFO, the 
Government invested $5.0  billion over five years from 2024 –25 in early  childhood 
education and care.  The Government has also reduced out -of-pocket costs for more than 
one million Australian families through Cheaper Child Care, which from July 2023 lifted 
Child Care Subsidy rates for families earning less than $530,000.

MYEFO highlights: Building a universal early childhood education and 
care system  
To support parents and carers to access affordable and high -quality early childhood 
education and care services, the Government is investing in building a universal 
early childhood education and care system. This includes:  
• $3.6 billion over four years from 2024 –25 to support a wage increase for the early 
childhood education and care workforce through a worker retention payment. 
This will support a wage increase of 10  per cent on top of the current national 
award rate in the first year from  December  2024 and a fur ther 5  per cent in the 
second year from  December  2025  
• $1.0 billion over five years from 2024 –25 to establish the Building Early Education 
Fund, including provisioning $500  million for future investments. This will see 
more centres built and expanded in areas of need, including in the outer suburbs 
and regional Australia, and will enable a business  case to be undertaken for the 
Government to invest in owning and leasing a portfolio of centres  
• $426.6  million over four years from 2025 –26 for the 3 Day Guarantee, which will 
replace the Child Care Subsidy Activity Test from  January  2026 to ensure families 
are eligible  for at least three days of Child Care Subsidy per week for early 
childhood education and care. Legislation to give effect to this change passed 
parliament on 13  February  2025  
• $10.4  million over three years from 2024 –25 to develop an Early Education 
Service Delivery Price to better understand the cost of delivering services around 
the country and underpin future reform.  
 
These reforms are an important step towards improving the accessibility, affordability and 
simplicity of early childhood education and care. Together they provide parents, 
particularly women, with greater choice to care and work to their preferred levels.  Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Unpaid and paid care  | Page 33 
Gender analysis in practice: Child Care Subsidy – 3 Day Guarantee  
The Government is improving access to affordable early childhood education and 
care by replacing the Child Care Subsidy Activity Test from  January  2026 to 
guarantee eligibility  for at least three days of subsidised early childhood education 
and care each week  (72 hours per fortnight) for Child Care Subsidy eligible families . 
Families caring for  a First Nations child will be eligible for 100 hours of subsidised 
care per fortnight . The 3  Day Guarantee will positively impact gender equality by 
providing cost -of-living relief for families, particularly single mothers and 
lower -income families , and removing barriers to women choosing how they balance 
caring responsibilities with other priorities .  
By replacing  the Activity Test, the Government has lifted the base number of 
subsidised hours families are eligible  for regardless of their level of activity. This 
change was informed by feedback from stakeholders representing First  Nations 
people who stated the previous Activity Test presented an extra barrier to 
First  Nations families already facing challenges accessing early childhood 
education  and care.  
Gender analysis concluded the 3  Day Guarantee will largely benefit women who 
primarily undertake unpaid care responsibilities. In particular, the 3  Day Guarantee 
will positively benefit unemployed single mothers and their children who will 
receive access to more subsidised hours than previously available. The 3  Day 
Guarantee increases access to subsidised hours, removing a barrier to their children 
accessing the benefits of early childhood education and care.  
ABS data indicates some women  may  want to work but are unable to do so as the 
cost or availability of early childhood education and care is a barrier. The 3  Day 
Guarantee will enable women to access the Child Care Subsidy  and participate or 
increase their participation in work, study, or volunteering, to their preferred levels.  
The 3  Day Guarantee also provides more certainty for women with unpredictable 
working patterns, for example if they work seasonally or periodically, about their 
entitlement to the Child Care Subsidy. Women working less than 48  hours 
per fortnight can rely on 72 subsidised hours of care regardless of  how these 
hours  fluctuate .

Bolstering supports for carers  
For many women, unpaid care also includes caring for ageing parents or other family 
members, including people with disability, chronic health conditions, and mental illness. 
54 per cent of these carers are women and this increases to 68  per cent for primary carers. 
In December  2024, the Government released its National Carer Strategy 2024 –2034  
(the Strategy) and accompanying Action Plan. The Strategy sets the direction for 
Government efforts to improve the lives of Australia ’s unpaid carers, including to support 
their health and wellbeing and to remain connected to economic and social opportunities. 
The Action Plan addresses priority areas of the Strategy and introduces practical and vital 
additional supports for carers. These supports empower carers to engage in workforce, 
education, or training opportunities and ensure carers can access necessary services and 
supports at a time and way that suits their needs.  
As announced in the 2024 –25 Budget, the Government has made changes to the 
participation rules for the Carer Payment, which took effect from 20  March  2025. 
Recognising carers are more likely to work in insecure casual work, leading to intermittent 
engagement with work, the new rules allow up to 100  hours of work over a four -week 
period instead of 25  hours per week , and remove travel time, education , and volunteering 
from the work limit . This change aims to provide carers with flexibility to balance work 
and study with their caring responsibilities, promoting long -term benefits such as increased 
income and superannuation, and improved health, mental and social wellbeing.  
Strengthening the care and support sector  
Care and support workers provide a vital service to Australia ’s economy and broader 
society. However, they can face challenges such as low pay and job insecurity, with a high 
proportion employed as casuals or contractors compared to the economy -wide average. In 
addition, in 2021, over 40  per cent of registered nurses and aged and disabled carers  were 
born overseas . This is higher than the average of 32  per cent across all occupations  and 
suggest s care and support workers are more likely to experience intersecting forms of 
disadvantage.  Australia is facing workforce shortages in the care and support economy, 
leading to care gaps for care recipients. To attract the necessary workforce, caring work 
must be properly valued, which should be reflected by appropriate pay and conditions. 
Fair pa y in these historically undervalued se ctors helps attract new workers, retain current 
workers, and close the gender pay gap.  
In this Budget, the Government continues to recognise paid care as an essential service for 
Australia and drive progress towards a sustainable and productive care and support 
economy that delivers quality care and support, with quality jobs. Reforms to car e and 
support systems have a two -fold impact on women ’s economic equality. Given 85  per cent 
of workers in the care and support economy are women, positive changes to remuneration 
policies support efforts to narrow the gender pay gap  and attract new worker s to the sector . 
An effective formal care and support system also benefits women, given they are more 
likely to provide informal and unpaid care when formal services are not available.  Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Unpaid and paid care  | Page 35 
Making remuneration fairer in the care professions and sectors  
Gendered undervaluation of feminised industries is well -established and perpetuates 
economic inequality. The perception of care and support work as ‘unskilled ’ exposes it to 
potential wage undervaluation, as the skills and expertise required to deliver care are 
overlooked and misunderstood. Across the economy, occupations with a larger share of 
women tend to have lower wages (Figure 3). Although differences in p ay between 
male - and female -dominated occupations are less stark today than a decade ago, many 
female -dominated care sector occupations, such as carers and aides, earn less than 
other  occupations.  
Figure 3: Average full -time weekly earnings, by 2 -digit occupation and 
proportion of women working in occupation  
 
Source:  ABS Characteristics of employment, 2024.  
Note:  Earnings are inflated to 2024 dollars with average weekly earnings. The size of the bubbles 
reflects the number of employees in each occupation.  
 
The Government is committed to supporting the fair remuneration of the care sector and is 
investing in wage increases for workers in aged care and early childhood education and 
care. Valuing care workforces will reduce the gender pay gap and support worker  
attraction and retention in a market facing workforce shortages .

Budget and MYEFO highlights: Wage increase s for aged care nurses  
Over successive Budget s the Government has invested $17.7  billion to deliver on its 
commitment to support the Fair Work Commission ’s decisions under the Aged Care 
Work Value Case. This includes:  
• in the 2025 –26 Budget, $2.6  billion for further award wage increases for aged care 
nurses from 1 March 2025  
• in the 2024 –25 MYEFO, $3.8  billion for the award wage increases from 
1 January  2025 (Stage 3)  
• in the 2023–24 Budget, $11.3  billion for the 15  per cent award wage increases, 
which commenced 30  June  2023 (Stage 2).  
As a result of the Fair Work Commission ’s decisions, all aged care workers under the 
Aged Care Award 2010; Schedule F of the Social, Community, Home Care and 
Disability Services Industry Award 2010 (SCHADS Award); and Nurses Award 2020 
are receiving award wage increases. This is around 400,000 workers. Aged care 
workers benefitting from the award wage increases include:  
• registered nurses, enrolled nurses, nurse practitioners, and assistants in nursing  
• personal care workers, recreational activities officers, and ancillary staff (such as 
administration staff, gardeners, laundry hands, cleaners head chefs, cooks, and 
food service assistants)  
• home care aged care workers.  
Hourly award wage rates have increased  significantly  as a direct result of  the 
Government ’s support for the  Aged Care Work Value Case . For instance, for a 
registered nurse ( level 2 , 1–3 years  of experience ) the hourly award wage rate has 
increased by $9.54  and for an a ged care employee (direct care – level 3 – qualified ) it 
has increased by $6.25 . 14 These wage increases will particularly benefit women, who 
comprise 86  per cent of the aged care workforce . 
 Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Unpaid and paid care  | Page 37 
MYEFO highlights: Wage increase for early childhood education and 
care workers  
In the 2024 –25 MYEFO, the Government provided $3.6 billion over four years from 
2024 –25 to support a wage increase for the early childhood education and care 
workforce through a worker retention payment. This will support a wage increase 
of 10 per cent on top of the current national award rate in the first year from 
December  2024 and a further 5  per cent in the second year from December  2025.  
The Government is also providing $10.0  million in 2024 –25 to sector peak bodies, 
employer organisations, and employee representative organisations to assist 
providers and their staff to engage with the worker retention payment.  
 
On 7  December  2022, the Government ’s legislation to make gender equality an objective of 
the Fair Work Act 2009  came into effect. These reforms embedded the principle of gender 
equality in the Fair Work Commission ’s decision -making processes and strengthened the 
Fair Work Commission ’s ability to award pay rises for equal remuneration or work value 
reasons, including to address gender -based undervaluation of work.  
On 7  June  2024, the Fair Work Commission initiated the Gender Undervaluation – Priority 
Awards Review (the Review), which seeks to remedy potential historical undervaluation in 
awards used in priority female -dominated industries. These awards are the Aboriginal and 
Torres  Strait Islander Health Workers and Practitioners and Aboriginal Community 
Controlled Health Services Award 2020, Children ’s Services Award 2010, Health 
Professionals and Support Services Award 2020, Pharmacy Industry Award 2020, and 
Social , Community, Home Care and Disability Services Industry Award 2010.  
The Government supports this Review. On 27  September  2024 , the Government made an 
initial submission to the Review, which was underpinned by the principles of advancing 
gender equality, the National Agreement on Closing the Gap, delivering consistent 
outcomes for workers, the need for an economically responsible phased approach to any 
wage increases, and balancing risks to business, workforce, and consumer outcomes.  
Building a stronger workforce pipeline  
Along with making the care sector more attractive by supporting fairer remuneration, the 
Government is acting to strengthen the workforce pipeline. A strong, diverse workforce, 
including with increased men ’s participation, will help the economy grow to meet present 
and future demand, break down stereotypes that care is ‘women ’s work ’, and reinforce that 
everyone can make valuable care contributions in both formal economies and unpaid 
settings.  
The Government is ensuring high -quality and responsive training is available for students 
wishing to enter the care and support sector. Through the National Skills Agreement, the 
Government is investing up to $325  million over five years from 2024 , with matched 
funding from states and territories, to establish nationally networked TAFE Centres of  
 
 | Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 38 | Unpaid and paid care  
Excellence to provide high -quality and responsive skills training in areas of national 
priority and critical and emerging industries, including sustaining essential care and 
support services. In 2024, governments announced the Queensland TAFE Centre of 
Excellence Health Care and Sup port and the South Australian TAFE Centre of Excellence in 
Early Childhood Education and Care.  
The Government is also strengthening the workforce pipeline by addressing financial 
disincentives for students pursuing care and support qualifications. In  November  2024, the 
Government passed legislation to introduce a Commonwealth Prac Payment, benchmarked 
to the single Austudy rate ($331.65  per week, as at 1  January  2025 ). The new payment will 
be available from 1  July 2025 for eligible nursing, midwifery, teaching, and social work 
students undertaking mandatory placements, helping to provide cost -of-living relief and 
combat placement poverty. The Commonwealth Prac Payment is expected to support 
around 68,000 higher education students and 5,000 VET students per year. Many of these 
students will likely be women . In 2022, women made up 81  per cent of enrolments in 
teaching, nursing, midwifery, and social work higher education courses, and 84  per cent of 
2022 commencements in the Diploma of Nursing.  
Budget highlight: Investing in the primary health care workforce  
To support the primary care workforce, the Government is investing $10.5  million 
over two years from 2 025–26 to expand the Primary Care Nursing and Midwifery 
Scholarship Program by 400 places.  
Given women represent almost 90  per cent of  the nursing and midwifery sector 
professions , women stand to benefit the most from  this measure . Participants will 
extend their skills and qualifications and attain endorsement as a nurse practitioner 
or endorsed  midwife.  
The Government is also investing $ 248.7  million over four years from 20 25–26 to 
provide salary incentives for junior doctors and  paid parental leave and study leave 
for trainee GPs to help compensate for the entitlements that junior doctors lose when 
they move out of the hospital system. Women made up 58 per cent of new GP 
trainees in 2024 . Improved access to paid parental leave  will help to address 
inequities between GP trainees and trainees in other medical  specialties .  
 
As well as strengthening the care sector workforce pipeline, the Government recognises the 
importance of supporting workers to keep growing their skills. To support the  professional 
development of early childhood education and care workers, in the 2023 –24 Budget the 
Government  provided $72.4  million over five years from 2022 –23 to assist  the sector to 
build and retain the workforce. This includes financial assistance for eligible educators to 
undertake paid practicums and a living and travel allowance for students undertaking a 
practicum in a rural or remote location away from their home. In  October  2024, a dedicated 
practicum exchange website was made available to help services and students organise 
practicum placement opportunities. Women's Budget Statement  |

There have been significant improvements in women ’s economic equality and security in 
recent years . Women ’s workforce participation reached  record high s in 2025  and the 
gender  pay gap hit record  lows  in 2024 .  
However, gaps  between women ’s and men ’s economic outcomes  persist . Women still earn 
less than men on average, are more likely to engage in part -time, low paid and insecure 
work, and are more likely to have a disrupted career trajectory due to unpaid caring 
responsibilities. Relationship breakdown and violence can also worsen women ’s economic 
insecurity. Progress on narrowing  gendered gaps has been slower for First  Nations women, 
women with disability and migrant and refugee women, as they  may  experience add itional 
and unique barriers. Experiences of economic inequality have lifelong impacts, including 
an inability to escape and recover from family and domestic violence, housing insecurity 
and homelessness, lower superannuation balances, and less security in retirement.  
As set out in Working for Women,  the Government is committed to improving economic 
equality and security for women  and addressing structural drivers of inequality.

Page 40 | Economic equality and security  
Since  May  2022, the Government has delivered significant investments and 
reforms,  including:  
• tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer, with a focus on improving incentives to 
participate and supporting women to work if they want to  
• Cheaper Child Care reforms and building the foundation for universal early childhood 
education and care  
• funding to increase wages for workers in highly feminised sectors including aged care 
and early childhood education and care  
• expanding Government -funded PPL to 26 weeks by 2026  and passing legislation for 
superannuation to be paid on payments made under the scheme  
• boosting support for women through the income support system, including expanding 
eligibility of Parenting Payment Single, enhancing the flexibility of Carer Payment rules 
and increasing the maximum rates of Commonwealth Rent Assistance  
• workplace reforms such as making gender equality an object of the Fair Work Act 2009 , 
making breastfeeding a protected attribute under the Fair Work Act 2009 , banning pay 
secrecy, legislating a statutory equal remuneration principle, introducing ten days of

discrimination and sex -based harassment  
• funding to support women ’s representation and opportunities in traditionally 
male -dominated industries, including through the Australian Skills Guarantee and the 
Building Women ’s Careers Program  
• funding to support women ’s access to housing, including through the 
Social  Housing  Accelerator Payment, Safe Places Emergency Accommodation Program, 
and the  National Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness.  
The Government is continuing  to drive progress towards economic equality and security  
for women,  including  through key cost-of-living relief  initiatives  and measures to help 
address structural and long -term drivers of women ’s lower workforce participation rates 
and the gender pay gap.

Providing cost -of-living relief to women and families  
While inflation is less than a third of its peak,  cost-of-living pressures continue to be felt 
broadly across the community. Key cost -of-living  relief initiatives over this Government ’s 
term include tax cuts for every taxpayer, energy bill relief for over ten million household s, 
fairer student loans, funding pay rises for aged care workers and early childhood 
educators, Cheaper Child Care and investments to make health  care more accessible and 
affordable . These measures have particularly benefitted low paid  workers, who are 
disproportionately women, as they typically do not have savings to draw on to cover rising 
costs. Single women in particular are far more likely to face indicators of financial stress 
compared with coupled households . 
The Government ’s tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer support women ’s workforce 
participation by reducing disincentives to take on more hours of work, especially for 
low- and middle -income earners , who are more likely to be women . 
The Government is extending energy bill relief to help families with their power bills. This 
is in addition to  the $3.5  billion in energy bill relief that is already being provided to over  
ten million households and around one million small businesses in 2024 –25.  
Budget highlight : Extending energy bill relief  
In this Budget, the Government is committing $1.8  billion to extend energy bill relief 
for six months to December 2025 . This will provide additional cost -of-living support 
for over ten million Australian households and around one  million small businesses. 
Rebates of up to $150 will directly reduce energy bills in the winter , helping 
households when they need it most. This relief particularly benefits  women, who are 
over -represented in low -income households and are typically more impacted by 
rising living costs.   
The Government has also delivered back -to-back increases in the maximum rates of 
Commonwealth Rent Assistance. These changes benefit nearly one million households 
eligible for the maximum rate, around 52  per cent of which are single women  households .  
To provide cost -of-living relief for Australians with student loan debts, the Government is 
continuing to make student loans fairer. This follows changes to the indexation of Higher 
Education Loan Program (HELP) and other student debts to the lower of the Consumer 
Price Index or the Wage Price Index. This change was backdated to 1  June  2023 and has 
removed $3  billion in outstanding student debt for 3  million Australians.   
 
 | Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 42 | Economic equality and security  
MYEFO highlight: Making student loans fairer  
The Government has committed to reducing HELP and other student loan debts by 
20 per cent before indexation is applied on 1  June  2025, subject to the passage of 
legislation. This would remove $16  billion in student loan debt.  
The Government has also committed $182.2  million over four years from 2024 –25 
(and $402.3  million from 2028 –29 to 2034 –35) to reform the repayment system for 
the HELP and other student loan schemes. This will deliver a fairer student loan 
repayment system that is based on marginal rates and will increase the amount 
people can earn before they are required to start repaying their loan. This reform 
will take effect from 1  July 2025, subject to the passage of legislation.  
These changes will benefit 1.8  million women who hold around 61  per cent 
of HELP  debts.  
 
Cameo: Cumulative impact of Government policy changes on women and 
families in 2024 –2518  
The Government ’s tax cuts, the Cheaper Child Care reforms, increases to 
Commonwealth Rent Assistance, the expansion of Parenting Payment Single 
eligibility, and energy bill relief have all provided cost -of-living support to low - and 
middle -income Australians. The Government has also boosted wages in the 
female -dominant sectors of early childhood education and care  and aged care, 
through an early childhood education and care worker retention payment  and 
funding the outcome of the Fair Work Commission ’s decis ion on the Aged 
Care  Work Value Case.  
Example : Rachael works full -time as an early childhood educator on the award 
wage ($57,436). Her rent is currently $350  per week, and she is the sole parent of a 
ten-year -old child who attends out -of-school -hours care five days a week. Under the 
Government ’s changes, Rachael will receive Parenting Payment Single of $4,720, a 
wage increase of $3,350 as a result of the worker retention payment , a tax cut of 
$1,301, an increase in rent assistance of $1,219 , energy bill relief of $300 and an 
additional $276 in Child Care Subsidy. After the tax paid on the wage increase and 
Parenting  Payment (Single ), Rachael will receive a net benefit of $8,489 in 2024 –25, 
equivalent to a 13.7  per cent increase in her disposable income .

Increasing women ’s workforce participation  
Reducing barriers to women ’s workforce participation is central to improving women ’s 
economic equality and security, with benefits also to their families and the economy. 
Women ’s workforce participation rates reached their highest on record at 63. 3 per cent 
in January  2025  (Figure 4 .1), representing an increase of almost 20  percentage points over 
the past 40  years. Increased participation rates have been driven by changing social 
attitudes, increased educational attainment for women, increased flexibility offered by 
employers, and caring work moving into the formal economy. The share of middle -aged 
women reporting home duties or caring responsibilities to be the main reason for be ing 
outside the workforce has halved over the past three decades ( Figure 4 .2).

The availability of remote working arrangements provides more options for families to 
choose  how to balance work and care and help s to support women ’s participation. Prior to 
the pandemic i n 2019, 25 per  cent of employed people did some work from home. This 
peaked at  37 per cent in 2021, before falling to 34 per cent in 2023.19  
Increasing prevalence of working from home has coincided with a marked increase in 
women ’s participation, particularly full -time participation  (Figure  4.3). The share of women 
participating full -time increased by 2.3  percentage points between the start of the pandemic 
and February  2025, while the share of men participating full -time has remained steady. 
Around 630,000 more women are working full time than prior to the pandemic. On  
 
 | Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 44 | Economic equality and security  
average, women working full time earn  around  $100,000 per year, compared with around 
$45,000 for women working part -time.20  
The benefits of remote work have been especially pronounced for women with children, 
who have increased their participation significantly more than other comparable workers.21 
Moreover, research has shown that people who work from home allocate 40  per cent of 
their saved commuting time to their jobs, and about 11  per cent to caring activities, with 
people with children allocating more of their time savings to caring.22

Note:  Women ’s full-time participation reflects the share of women over 15 who are working full -time 
or actively searching for full -time work. The concept of full -time and part -time participation 
rates  and their value to considering long -run trends in participation is discussed further in 
Gustafsson  (2019).23  
 
The Government has acted to further break down barriers to participation and increase 
opportunities for women. This includes making early childhood education and care 
cheaper and more accessible, improving Government -funded PPL (see  Chapter 2: 
Unpaid  and paid care  for further detail), investing in skills development, and providing tax 
relief that supports participation and lowers barriers to work . 
Parents of young children who spend time out of the workforce to have and care for 
children  may  face additional barriers to workforce participation (see Chapter 2 : 
Unpaid  and paid care  for further detail). To assist these parents, on 1  November  2024, the 
Government implemented the new voluntary Parent Pathways service. This service 
provides personalised assistance and financial support to eligible parents and carers with a 
youngest child aged under six years to support their education, employment , and career 
goals. Support  may include training, career guidance and language or lit eracy programs. Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Economic equality and security  | Page 45 
Single women with young children are most likely to benefit from this new service, given 
they are far more likely to receive  Parenting Payment.  
Narrowing the gender pay gap  
The gender pay gap has narrowed significantly to reach record lows in 2024. Recent 
progress to close the gap has been especially marked. Since May  2022, the gender pay gap, 
which is the difference in base salary earnings between women and men in full -time work, 
has reduced by 2.2  percentage points to 11.9  per cent in November 2024. This follows a 
three -year period in which the gender pay gap held steady at around 14  per cent.  
This progress has been driven in part by recent increases to minimum and award wages, as 
women are disproportionately represented in low -paid and award -reliant jobs.  The 
Government has backed wage growth for low -paid workers in each of the last three Annual 
Wage Reviews, which have seen the  National Minimum Wage increas e by almost $7,500 a 
year. The Government also supports  the Fair Work Commission ’s Gender Undervaluation 
– Priority Awards Review, which  seeks to remedy potential historical undervaluation in 
awards used in priority female -dominated industries . 
Despite this progress, the gender pay gap continues to persist from the time women start 
their careers. On average, women working full -time earn $246.30 less per week or 
$12,807.60 less per year than men working full -time. This is driven by a range of complex, 
interrelated, and often compounding factors, including differences in gender representation 
and remuneration across occupations and industries, the impact of caring responsibilities 
on patterns of work, and gende r discrimination and bias.  
The gender pay gap is even greater after accounting for the total remuneration of full -time, 
part-time, and casual employees  – although this gap is also falling . The Workplace Gender 
Equality Agency (WGEA) calculates the average total remuneration gap for employees in 
private sector organisations with 100 or more employees at 21.1  per cent in 2023 –24 – a 
decrease of 1.7  percentage points from 2021 –22. In addition to base salary, this gap also 
accounts for superannuation, overtime, bonuses, and other additio nal payments, with 
part-time and casual roles converted into annualised full -time equivalent earnings. Taking 
into account CEO, Head of Business and Casual Manager remuneration, which was 
included  for the first time in the 2023 –24 WGEA data, the gender pay gap for 2023 –24 
is 21.8 per cent.  
Experimental analysis of the HILDA Survey has enabled an understanding of how pay 
differs for some diverse groups ( Figure 5). On average, men working full -time earn around 
$1,970 per week, compared to $1,720 for women who work full -time. Women from 
culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, LGB+ women, women with disability , 
and women in regional areas earn less than other women, on average.24 In 2023, the gender 
pay gap between culturally and linguistically diverse women and men is 18  per cent, 
higher than that for all women and men (13  per cent).  This points towards the  intersectional 
impacts of gender inequality experienced by a range of women with different backgrounds, 
identities and lived experiences.

Publishing employer gender pay gaps  
In March  2025, WGEA published the gender pay gaps for private sector employers with 
100 or more employees for the second time. Covering 2023 –24, this publication shows some 
progress , with 56  per cent of employers improving their gender pay gap in the last year . 
However, 72  per cent of employers still have a gender pay gap in favour of men ( Figure  6). 
Across every industry, firms are more likely to have a pay gap in favour of men than 
women. The second publication included average pay gaps for the first time , as well as  new 
data, such as the employer gender pay gaps for corporate groups and subsidiaries of 
corporate groups.  Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Economic equality and security  | Page 47 
Figure 6: Distribution of average employer gender pay gaps  
 
Source:  WGEA employer gender pay gaps (2025)  
Notes:  Only includes private sector firms with more than 100 employees. Gender pay gaps are calculated 
using employee ’s total remuneration, including bonuses. The pay gap is the difference in average 
male and female earnings, expressed as a proportion of male earnings . A ‘neutral ’ gender pay gap 
includes firms where male and female remuneration is within +/ - 5 per cent.  
 
The Government ’s publication of employer gender pay gaps is a catalyst for change. 
For employers, it is an opportunity to reconsider how they hire, promote, retain , and 
remunerate their staff. Employees are also better equipped to make more informed choices 
about where they work. Greater transparency on gender pay gaps also fosters more 
informed public discussion of gender equality issues, drives accountability acros s 
employers, and promotes better practices through comparability and peer review.  
Publication of employer gender pay gaps has also enabled new insights into the gender 
pay gap in the private sector, including how women and men  are paid across industries. 
The data highlights  that industries with greater gender segregation also tend to have 
higher  gender pay gaps. On average, employer -level pay gaps in 2023 –24 were  largest 
in male -dominated industries such as construction and mining, and smallest in 
female -dominated industries such as health care and social assistance ( Figure 7 ). In 
general,  workplaces in industries employing a larger share of women tend to report 
lower  gender  pay gaps.

equivalent for casual and part -time employees.  
 
Encouraging employer -level action  
The Government has introduced legislation that, when passed,  will require large employers 
to commit to achieving gender equality targets over three years and report their progress to 
WGEA. Where employers fail to set targets and achieve, or make progress towards , their 
targets in a three -year period, they will be ineligible for a certificate of compliance from 
WGEA. Employers must supply a certificate of compliance to be considered for 
government contracts above certain thresholds. Through greater transpare ncy and 
accountability, this will encourage further employer -level action to close the gender pay 
gap and assist employees to make more informed choices about where they work.  
Enhancing long -term economic equality and security  
for women  
Improving economic outcomes for women requires a range of policy levers to target 
structural and long -term drivers of inequality. This includes building a more 
gender -balanced workforce, supporting more women in full -time employment, improving 
women ’s housing security, and ensuring the retirement income system works for everyone. 
Prioritising long -term investment in these areas will support women ’s workforce 
participation and help close the gender gaps in pay and superannuation.  Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Economic equality and security  | Page 49 
Building a more gender -balanced workforce  
Harnessing all available talent and increasing women ’s workforce participation across 
male -dominated industries is key to closing the gender pay gap, addressing workforce 
shortages, and supporting key national priorities, including the transition to net zero.  
However, the Australian workforce remains highly gender -segregated by industry and 
occupation. Female -dominated industries and occupations, such as education and training 
and health care and social assistance, tend to have lower average rates of pay than 
gender -balanced and male -dominated occupations and industries, which contributes to the 
gender pay gap  (Figure 8) . In addition, women remain under -represented in managerial 
and executive positions across industries, including in the highest -paying industries and in 
fema le-dominated industries.

annualised to full -time equivalent for casual and part -time employees.  
 
Breaking down gender segregation in the workforce requires addressing the key barriers 
faced by women in workplaces. This includes reducing the incidence of workplace sexual 
harassment and discrimination, improving workplace culture, making workplaces safer 
and more inclusive for everyone, removing barriers for remuneration and care er 
progression opportunities, supporting access to suitable workplace amenities and personal 
protective equipment, and increasing diversity in the pipeline of future workers. It also 
means addressing the undervaluation of feminised jobs, the unequal share of unpaid work 
and care, and gender stereotypes that influence education and career choices.   
 
 | Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 50 | Economic equality and security  
The Government is taking action to reduce gender segregation and address workforce 
shortages by supporting more women to pursue careers in key high -demand industries. 
This includes through the Australian Skills Guarantee, the Building Women ’s Careers 
Program, Free TAFE , and the Future Made in Australia agenda.  Through WGEA, the 
Government is also collecting and publishing  data about how employers are preventing 
and responding to sexual harassment in the workplace. This offers insight into the 
implementation  of the positive duty on employers to take reasonable steps to eliminate 
workplace sexual harassment, sex discrimination and sex -based harassment, and how any 
gaps can be addressed.  
Promoting gender equality in gender -segregated industries  
MYEFO highlights: Reducing gender segregation in Australia ’s workforce  
The Government is providing $16.4  million over two years from 2024 –25 to pilot 
innovative solutions to advance gender equality in gender segregated industries, 
occupations, and workplaces. These solutions aim to increase workplace flexibility, 
build inclusive workplace cultures, and ensure workplace facilities and amenities are 
adequate for the health, safe ty and dignity of women and parents in 
male -dominated industries and workplaces.  
The Government is also providing $70.0  million over three years from 2025 –26 to 
establish the First  Nations Clean Energy Futures Grants Program, which will reduce 
barriers to accessing clean energy for First  Nations communities and support new 
First  Nation s led clean energy projects. Under this program, First  Nations women 
will be supported to participate in the clean energy transition through targeted 
outreach, gender -inclusive training, and capacity building, and to engage with and 
develop leadership role s in community -led energy programs and projects . 
 
The Government is supporting women through  the implementation of the Future Made in 
Australia agenda, including through the Community Benefit Principles. These principles 
ensure investments made under the agenda benefit local workers and businesses, and 
specifically promote the development of more skilled and inclusive workforces, including 
for women.  
The Future Made in Australia agenda will support gender equality through the design and 
implementation of key programs, including the  $1.7 billion Future Made in Australia 
Innovation Fund, the $1 billion Green Iron Investment Fund  and the $10.0  million Green 
Metals Innovation Network. For example, the Green Metals Innovation Network will 
support the development of the future green metals workforce, including supporting the 
participation of women and First  Nations Australians.  Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Economic equality and security  | Page 51 
Gender analysis in practice: Green Iron Investment Fund  
The Government ’s new $1  billion Green Iron Investment Fund will boost green iron 
manufacturing and supply chains by supporting early mover green iron projects and 
unlocking private investment at scale.  
The current iron ore mining sector is male -dominated. WGEA ’s research shows 
women in male -dominated industries are typically under -represented across all 
levels, including in leadership and management, and experience significant gender 
pay gaps. While most metals manufacturing companies are taking steps to meet 
diversity targets, gender disparity still exists at the leadership level. For example, in 
the primary metal and metal product manufacturing subsector, women comprise 
only 19  per cent of the managemen t workforce and 14  per cent of CEOs. Similarly, in 
the fabricated metal product manufacturing subsector, women comprise only 
16 per cent of the management workforce  and 10 per cent of CEOs.  
In designing the Green Iron Investment Fund, the Department of Industry, Science 
and Resources will consider how the fund can provide benefits for communities , 
including how the fund can be used to develop a more skilled and inclusive 
workforce. Along with the economic opportunities of a competitive green iron 
industry, this is expected to encourage more women to join the iron sector and 
support women to remain  in the sector for longer, including through increased 
representation at leadership levels . 
 
Promoting gender equality in national skills and training systems  
Structural and cultural change to support greater diversity and inclusion is needed to 
increase women ’s workforce participation in traditionally male -dominated industries and 
occupations , including thos e in science, technology, engineering , and mathematics (STEM). 
In 202 2, women made up 37  per cent of enrolments in university STEM courses and just 
17 per cent of vocational education and training (VET) STEM enrolments.  
The Government has scaled up its initiatives to improve opportunities for women, girls and 
gender diverse people in STEM education and careers. In 2024, the Government announced 
an additional $3.8 million over seven years from 2024 –25 to Science and Technology 
Australia to deliver its Superstars of STEM program, to boost the profile of diverse women 
and non -binary role models in STEM. It also announced an additional $7.1  million over five 
years from 2024 –25 for Science in Australia Gender Equity to deliver  an expanded diversity 
in science accreditation framework. This will help create safe, diverse and inclusive 
workplaces in the higher education, research and VET sector.   
   
 
 | Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 52 | Economic equality and security  
The inaugural National Skills Plan, which was published in  September  2024 and forms part 
of the National Skills Agreement, reaffirms the Government ’s ambitions for reducing 
gender segregation in the VET sector and related occupations, and ensuring the VET sector 
is inclusive, safe and supportive for women. This is supported by individual  
Commonwealth, state, and territory plans, which detail the action being taken individually 
and collaboratively to address national priorities, including gender equality. Th ese plans 
will be reviewed annually to ensure progress is sustained.  
The Government  has partnered with states and territories to deliver over $1.5 billion 
funding for Free TAFE over 2023 to 2026 , and is investing a further $1.6 billion in making 
Free TAFE permanent from 2027 . The existing Free TAFE program has already seen more 
than 568,000 enrolments for courses in national and state priority areas  between 
January  2023 and September 2024 , with 62.3  per cent being taken up by women. Data from  
the National Centre for Vocational Education Research for  September  2024 has found that 
almost 80  per cent more women are training as apprentices in male -dominated trades 
compared to 2019 , albeit off a low base . 
MYEFO highlight: Ongoing Free TAFE  
The Government is supporting more women to obtain a VET qualification by 
providing $253.7  million over two years from 2026 –27 (and an additional $1.4  billion 
from 2028 –29 to 2034 –35) to make Free TAFE an enduring program from 2027, 
supporting at least 100, 000 places a year. Free TAFE will prioritise cohorts that 
typically face barriers to education and employment such as women, First Nations 
people, people with disability, the unemployed and those on income support. The 
Government introduced legislation to give effect to this investment 
in November  2024.  
Free TAFE will support women ’s equitable access to education and training. 
Completing a VET course offers pathways to well -paid and rewarding work, 
including a median income uplift of $11,800 in the year following completion. 
Women graduates also had a 17  percentage point increase in employment, reaching 
an employment rate of 83  per cent after completion.  
 
Access to secure and affordable housing  
Secure and affordable housing is a key enabler of meaningful economic and social 
participation. Women are increasingly at higher risk of experiencing housing insecurity and 
homelessness in retirement than men, and single women who do not own their home are  at 
the greatest risk of poverty in retirement. One of the leading causes of housing insecurity 
for women and children is family and domestic violence. Older women are also at a higher 
risk due to compounding factors such as career interruptions for unpaid  care, insecure 
work arrangements, and lower lifetime earnings.  Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Economic equality and security  | Page 53 
The Government is expanding crisis and transitional, social , and affordable housing for 
vulnerable Australians, including older women and women and children impacted by 
family and domestic violence (see Chapter 1: Gender -based violence  for further detail). These 
investments will ease the strain on crisis accommodation, reduce unmet need for 
transitional housing, and strengthen pathways into longer -term housing for more women 
and children. The Government also supports first home buyers and single parents and 
guardians into home ownership through the Home Guarantee Scheme. Since  May  2022, the 
Scheme has supported over 74,900 women, including over 3,000 single mothers or single 
female guardians with a dependent through the Family Home Guara ntee.  
Strengthening women ’s retirement outcomes  
In 2022 –23, the median superannuation balance for women aged 60 to 64 approaching 
retirement was 24. 5 per cent less than men of the same age (Figure 9). The gap between the 
retirement incomes of women and men  is narrower than the gap in working -life earnings 
and superannuation balances. This is primarily due to the Age Pension, which helps offset 
some of the inequity women face in their working life .

Superannuation will be paid  on Government -funded PPL for babies born or adopted on or 
after 1  July 2025. This recognises the important contribution parents make to society and 
the value of unpaid care. It will also reduce the impact of parental leave on retirement 
outcomes, particularly for women, who  are overwhelmingly the recipients of 
Government -funded PPL.  This builds on the Government ’s expansion of 
Government -funded PPL by two weeks every year until it reaches  26 weeks in July  2026 .

Australians have different experiences of health due to variations in both sex 
(biological  characteristics) and gender (sociocultural norms). Across all forms of care, 
women face disproportionally higher financial costs and significant barriers to access due 
to a range of factors, including sex and gender bias in the health system.27 Targeted and 
tailored support is essential to support the unique and multifaceted health needs and 
experiences of women, including by considering the experience s and needs of women in 
whole -of-population health systems and interventions.  
As outlined in Working for Women  and the National Women ’s Health Strategy 2020 –2030 , 
socioeconomic  status , higher health  care expenses, and limited availability of treatment 
options all hinder women ’s access to affordable, targeted care, reflecting implicit and 
explicit bias against women within the system .  
 
 | Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 56 | Health  
Different dimensions of a person ’s identity can also intersect and influence their 
experiences and outcomes in the health system. Financial barriers and experiences of bias 
and discrimination are compounded for women who live with disability, are First Nations 
people, identify as LGBTIQA+ , are from culturally and linguistically diverse communities, 
or from rural and regional communities . Working for Women  highlights that sex and gender 
bias in the health system can lead to a lack of or delayed diagnosis and  treatment, resulting 
in poorer health outcomes .  
The Government ’s focus on enhanced access and affordability of women ’s health  care 
enables continued progress under Working for Women,  which outlines the need to improve 
sex and gender equity in health care through more targeted and effective treatments, better 
care delivery, and enhanced data and information.  
Since the 2022 –23 October Budget, the Government has committed more than $23 .5 billion 
to Strengthening Medicare and made  significant investments in targeted women ’s health 
care as part  of this Budget . This Budget increase s health care access and affordability, 
including increased access to bulk billing and urgent care , and reduced costs for treatments 
and medicines for sexual, reproductive and maternal health. This includes delivering 
affordable contraceptive options, enhanced access to services and treatm ent for in vitro 
fertilisation (IVF) , endometriosis and menopause, and tailored mental and maternal health 
services for all Australian women.  
Strengthening women ’s health  care across the life course  
Women and girls face a range of health needs and challenges throughout their lives, from 
puberty to pregnancy, motherhood, perimenopause, menopause and beyond. However, 
these needs have long been shrouded in shame and stigma, with inadequate treatment 
options stemming from deep -rooted sex and gender bias in the healthcare system. The 
National Women ’s Health Advisory Council ’s 2023 –24 annual report highlighted the 
extensive impact of sex and gender bias on women ’s lives and in the health system, 
including st ructural barriers, feelings of abandonment and self -doubt, delayed diagnosis 
and treatment, higher health  care out-of-pocket costs, and lost educational and 
career  opportunities.28  
Without affordable and accessible care, these challenges can negatively impact women ’s 
quality of life, physical and mental health, and ability to fully participate in the economy 
and their communities. This Budget delivers significant  investments in targeted women ’s 
health  care to provide more choice, lower costs and better health  care for women , while 
tackling sex and  gender bias in the health system. This includes providing more affordable 
contraceptive and IVF treatments, greater access to endometriosis  and menopause care, 
mental health and maternal care, and training and resources for patients and clinicians to 
better understand women ’s needs and health treatment s.   Women's Budget Statement  |

Sexual and reproductive health  
Supporting and promoting the sexual and reproductive health and rights of all 
Australians  is crucial in empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their 
bodies and maintaining women ’s quality of life as they age. The Government is making a 
landmark investment in women ’s health in response to two recent Senate Inquiries , on 
universal access to reproductive health  care and issues related to menopause and 
perimenopause. Both inquiries heard from stakeholders, including women with lived 
experience and  academics, with the Government supporting or supporting in p rinciple 
36 recommendations from the reproductive health  care inquiry  and 16 recommendations 
from the menopause inquiry .  
Addressing sexual and reproductive health is also a priority in the National Women’s Health 
Strategy  2020–2030 , which acknowledges that inadequate access to health  care can 
negatively affect women ’s mental, emotional, and physical health. To support women ’s 
quality of life and full participation in their communities, in education and in the economy, 
women ’s sexual and reproductive health needs must be met across their life span .  
Increased choice and lower costs for contraceptives  
While around  two-thirds  of Australian women between the ages of 18 and 44 use a form of 
contraception ,29 the cost of the most effective options can be a major barrier to uptake. The 
Senate Inquiry into universal access to reproductive health  care found that women continue 
to bear most of the financial burden for sexual and reproductive health  care, in particular 
contraception.30 In Australia, one in three women aged 18  to 39 who use the combined oral 
contraceptive pill are paying for a non -PBS listed pill which costs them hundreds of dollars 
each year.31 
Australian women also have some of the lowest uptake amongst comparable countries of 
long -term reversible contraceptives (LARCs) like intrauterine contraceptive devices or birth 
control implants, despite these being one of the most effective and cost -effective forms of 
contraception. LARC use in Australia remains low at approximately 11  per cent and is 
below the international benchmark of 15  per cent.32 For LARCs to be more accessible, cost, 
service and educational barriers must be addressed, including by increasing the number of 
health professionals who are appropriately trained in insertion and removal.  
As part of the Government ’s ongoing efforts to make medicines cheaper, this Budget 
invest s in additional contraceptive options to deliver more choice , lower costs  and to 
modernise women ’s health  care. The listing s of Yaz® and Yasmin® from 1  March  2025 
represent  the first Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) listings for new oral contraceptive 
pills in over 30  years, while the listing of Slinda® from 1  May  2025 will further increase 
access to a range of cheaper hormonal contraception options. This Budget als o build s on 
earlier investment s by establishing eight  LARC centres of excellence to train GPs and nurse 
practitioners to insert and remove LARCs , and by increas ing LARC Medicare rebates, 
estimated to save around  300,000 women up to $400  each year . Greater access to affordable 
contraceptive options will support women ’s overall quality of life by helping to reduce 
unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions and sexually transmitted infections, while easing 
the cost -of-living.

More support for women experiencing menopause and perimenopause  
One in four women aged 45 –64 report experiencing  menopause symptoms that have made 
it hard to do their daily activities. Menopause increases the risk of developing many serious 
health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dementia and osteoporosis , and 
can have broad implications for a woman ’s participation in the workforce, financial 
security, relationships and overall wellbeing.  
As highlighted in the Senate Inquiry into issues related to menopause and perimenopause, 
many women feel the health system does not provide adequate support for the experiences 
of menopause and perimenopause, including limited access to much needed treatment and 
support. Women have felt dismissed by healthcare professionals and vulnerable to harmful 
health misinformation, while access to hormone replacement therapies is hindered by 
shortages, prescribing hesitancy and inadequate subsidies. The Inquir y also  emphasised  
significant challenges associated with diagnosis  and a need to improve healthcare 
professionals ’ ability to manage and advise on menopause.33 
To improve health  care and treatment  accessibility  for perimenopause and menopause, the 
Government has introduced three new types of menopausal therapies to the PBS for the 
first time in 20  years. A new Medicare rebate for menopause health assessments has also 
been introduced to support management of symptoms, address long term risks and 
promote overall wellbeing. To increase health professional capability , funding is provided 
for health professionals to undertake additional training in menopause and 
perimenopause , and to develop the first -ever national cl inical guidelines to improve 
quality  of care. These t argeted investments support improved care experiences and 
health  outcomes for women dealing with menopause and perimenopause.  
Enhancing endometriosis care  
Around one in nine Australian women suffer from  endometriosis. On average, it takes 
seven years to receive an endometriosis diagnosis, and the overall annual cost of 
endometriosis is estimated to be $30,900 per person.  
This Budget improves the affordability of endometriosis treatment on the PBS and 
increases targeted health  care for endometriosis.  Diagnosis timeframes and early access to 
intervention and treatment options will be further improved by the establishment of eleven 
new endometriosis and pelvic pain clinics, and by an expanded  scope of all 33  clinics to 
support women seeking specialised support to manage menopause and 
perimenopause  symptoms.  
Supporting this is the future introduction, from 1  November  2025, of a new dedicated  
Medicare  Benefits Schedule ( MBS ) ultrasound item to support women with  severe  
endometriosis.  Women's Budget Statement  |

Budget highlights: More choice, lower costs and cheaper medicines 
for women  
The Government is investing $792.9  million over five years from 2024 –25 to improve 
health  care access and affordability for women. This package includes measures 
which improve contraceptive choice, provide more support for menopause and 
perimenopause and enhance endometriosis care.  
Improving contraceptive choice  
The Government is creating more choice and delivering lower costs for 
contraceptive options by:  
• listing the new oral contraceptive pills drospirenone with ethinylestradiol 
(Yaz®  and Yasmin®) on the PBS from 1 March 2025. These are the first new oral 
contraceptive pills listed in more than 30 years and are expected to benefit more 
than 50,000 women  who would otherwise pay around $380 per year and will 
now pay $126.40 a year, or just $30.80 a year with a concession card . 
• listing the oral contraceptive drospirenone (Slinda®) on the PBS from 
1 May  2025, which is expected to benefit 100,000 women each year  
• improving access to LARCs by reducing costs and incentivising bulk billing, with 
larger Medicare rebates under the MBS for the insertion and removal of LARCS 
with the new rebates also covering LARC delivery by Nurse Practitioners, and 
with the introduction of a 40 per cent bulk billing loading  
• establishing eight LARC Centres of Training Excellence, to ensure healthcare 
professionals are trained, skilled and confident when delivering 
these  critical  services  
• supporting two national trials to make it cheaper and easier for women to access 
contraceptives and treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections.  
More support for menopause and perimenopause  
The Government is providing support for women experiencing menopause and 
perimenopause by:  
• listing new menopause hormone therapies estradiol (Estrogel®), progesterone 
(Prometrium®) and estradiol and progesterone (Estrogel Pro ®) on the PBS from 
1 March  2025, with around 150,000 women saving hundreds of dollars per year 
in out -of-pocket expenses  
• introducing a new Medicare item for menopause health assessments to ensure 
women can get the care and support they need from their general  practitioner   
continued on next page

Page 60 | Health  
Budget highlights: More choice, lower costs and cheaper medicines for 
women (continued)  
• funding for health professionals to access education and training on menopause 
and perimenopause, the develop ment of national  clinical guidelines, and a 
national public health awareness campaign to increase understanding of 
menopause and perimenopause symptoms and  treatment  options . 
Enhancing endometriosis care  
The Government is also improving access to more effective and high -quality models 
of care for endometriosis and pelvic pain by:  
• delivering 11 new Endometriosis and Pelvic Pain Clinics across Australia, 
bringing the total to 33, and expanding their scope to support women seeking 
specialist support for menopause and perimenopause symptoms  
• listing the new endometriosis treatment option relugolix with estradiol and with 
norethisterone  (Ryeqo®) on the PBS from 1 May, which is expected to benefit 
8,500 women each year  
• establishing a dedicated endometriosis diagnostic ultrasound item to support 
women with endometriosis , as part of the Government ’s broader investment for 
new and amended  Medicare Benefits Schedule  items . 
 
MYEFO highlight: Cheaper medicines and more health information 
for women  
The Government has listed dienogest (Visanne®) on the PBS to treat patients with 
endometriosis from 1 December 2024. This daily treatment works to shrink and 
suppress the growth of abnormal tissue. Without subsidy, patients might pay 
around $750 per year f or treatment . 
 
Maternal health  
The journey of conceiving, pregnancy, and childbirth represents some of the most 
significant transitions in life, often accompanied by profound physical, emotional, and 
socioeconomic changes. Undiagnosed health issues during pregnancy and the post -birth 
period can contribute to maternal and perinatal health risks. In Australia  in 2021 , the rate of 
late gestation stillbirths (after 28 weeks) was 2.4 per 1,000 births, and stillbirths account ed 
for three quarters of perinatal deaths.34 Pregnancy and neonatal loss can also be a traumatic 
experience for women and can have lasting impacts on their physical and mental health.  Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Health  | Page 61 
While the Australian healthcare system delivers safe and high -quality maternal care, there 
are still areas for improvement. This Budget ’s investments in antenatal and post -natal  care 
and the maternity workforce (including through the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Education 
and Training Program), and ongoing investments to reduce  stillbirth rates , will ensure that 
all women having children can access safe, appropriate and high -quality maternal health  
care. Recognising the importance of community -driven, strengths -based approaches for 
First Nations communities, culturally safe First Nations maternal health services will also 
continue to be delivered through initiatives  like Birthing on Country, in partnership with 
the Aboriginal community controlled  maternal health workforce.  
Budget highlights: Supporting maternal health care across Australia  
The Government is providing $662.6  million over five years from 2024 –25 to 
strengthen and support the health workforce. This includes support for the 
maternity workforce, such as:  
• expanding the Primary Care Nursing and Midwifery Scholarship Program to 
support nurses and midwives to undertake post -graduate study  
• supporting the construction of the Nursing and Midwifery Academy in Victoria, 
to provide professional development pathways to enable nurses and midwives to 
enhance their critical leadership, research and training and education skills  
• providing $1.3  million over two years from 2024 –25 to extend the Obstetrics and 
Gynaecology Education and Training Program which provides upskilling and 
training opportunities for multidisciplinary  teams  in obstetrics and gynaecology. 
This program has demonstrated a positive impact in rural and remote areas, 
being instrumental in enhancing the quality of maternity and related health 
services.  
Ensuring continuity of maternity services  
The Government has also announced funding to support the continuity of maternity 
services in Hobart and Gosford, providing $6.0  million over two years from 2024 –25 
to the Tasmanian Government and $10.0  million over four years from 2025 –26 to the 
New South Wales Government.  
More affordable access to early IVF treatment  
From 1 April  2025 , women with specific low levels of reproductive hormones will 
have earlier access to a combination therapy known as Pergoveris® (follitropin alfa 
with lutropin alfa) through the PBS. This was previously only funded in later IVF 
cycles. Over 6,000 women ac cess Pergoveris® on the PBS each year, many who  
require four pens to complete a cycle. In response, double the maximum number of 
Pergoveris pens (four instead of two) per script will be listed .

MYEFO  highlights: Providing support throughout the maternity journey  
Fertility  support  
The Government provided $0.6  million in 2025 –26 to the University of New South 
Wales for the maintenance and improvement of the YourIVFSuccess website, to 
support Australian couples with independent advice and information on fertility 
support services and IVF. 
Support for antenatal and post -natal care  
From 3 February  2025, the maternal respiratory syncytial  virus  vaccine (Abrysvo®) 
was added to the National Immunisation Program ($174.5  million 2024 –2028). The 
vaccine is now free for eligible pregnant women, ensuring they can protect their 
baby against serious illness from respiratory syncytial virus , which is a leading cause 
of hospitalisation in children aged less than 6  months.  
As part of the preventive health measure, the Government invested $187.9  million 
over five years from 2024 –25, including:  
• $5.1 million to continue delivery of the Every Moment Matters awareness 
campaign in 2025 –26, to support women to achieve alcohol -free pregnancies 
and reduce the incidence of babies born with fetal  alcohol spectrum disorder   
• $5.3 million for perinatal mental health screening across public antenatal and 
postnatal care settings  
• $3.1 million to extend the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood ’s role to continue 
providing pasteurised donor human milk to premature babies in neonatal 
intensive care units or special care units across the hospital network  
• $2.6 million to continue support for the Australian Breastfeeding Association ’s 
National Breastfeeding Helpline, to provide a free call service on breastfeeding 
to women and families.  
Support for families experiencing stillbirth  
The Government has provided $7.1  million to extend a range of services to reduce 
the stillbirth rate in Australia and to ensure high quality care for families who 
experience stillbirth, with a focus on women from high -risk population cohorts.  
First Nations women ’s maternal health  
The Government has supported the extension of ten existing Birthing on Country 
services to provide First Nations midwifery continuity of care to First Nations 
women and babies for a further 12  months to 30  June  2026.

Women ’s wellbeing and mental health  
Mental health, and access to care, is impacted by a range of social and economic inequities 
which are disproportionately experienced by women . The National Women ’s Health Strategy 
2020–2030  highlights that key factors affecting women ’s mental health are socioeconomic 
factors, poor access to tailored mental health services and unique challenges at different life 
stages. A higher prevalence of chronic conditions among women increases their risk of 
mental health conditions, driving strong  demand for mental health services. In their 
lifetimes, one in three women have anxiety and one in six have depression, conditions 
made likelier in the event of domestic and sexual violence which can then re sult in 
post -traumatic stress and other disorders. Women also account for 67  per cent of eating 
disorders,35 and experience particular mental health challenges associated with pregnancy 
and menopause.  
First Nations women face significant mental health challenges, including higher rates 
of mental health conditions and suicide  than non -Indigenous men and women , often 
stemming from historical trauma, social determinants and lack of culturally 
appropriate  support services. Around one in four First Nations people aged 15 and over 
(26 per cent)  would have liked to access support for their mental health but did not in the 
last 12 months.  
This Budget is responding to  barriers in accessing mental health by delivering funding for 
culturally appropriate care f or First Nations peoples, and high -quality free digital mental 
health for all Australians. Investments in psychosocial support, early intervention, eating 
disorders and mental health training for nurses and allied health professionals will 
strengthen the mental health workforce and improve mental health outcomes .

Culturally safe mental health supports for First Nations people  
The Government is investing $24.7 million over four years from 2025 –26 to establish 
a flexible funding pool for First Nations social and emotional wellbeing and mental 
health activities, new social and emotional wellbeing assessment tools and processes, 
and support for 150  First Nations psychology students.  
Digital Mental Health Services  
The Government is investing $ 46.0 million over four  years from 2024 –25 to continue 
digital mental health services. This funding is in addition to the $135.2  million 
announced by the Government in February  2025  to deliver high -quality, free digital 
mental health supports for all Australians.  
Wellbeing support for the LGBTIQA+ community  
The Government is providing $0.4  million in 2025 –26 to QLife for the continued 
delivery of LGBTIQA+ peer support and referral services . 
 
MYEFO highlights: Better mental health outcomes

Funding included $4.6  million in 2025 –26 to support upskilling the mental health 
workforce in evidence -based eating disorder interventions, $1.0  million in 2025 –26 
for the National Eating Disorder Collaboration , and $0.2  million in 2025 –26 to 
provide in -person phone and online services for unpaid carers of people with eating 
disorders.  
The Government committed $272.1  million over two  years from 2025 –26 to extend 
Commonwealth psychosocial support activities. This will directly benefit women, 
who make up over 60 per cent of the Commonwealth Psychosocial Support Program 
users living with severe mental illness .

Improving health  care access, affordability and quality 
for women  
For many women in Australia, getting the care they need is not a matter of whether they 
need it, but whether they can afford it. Alongside their varied health needs across the life 
course, women have a higher disease burden of chronic conditions, requiring  more 
frequent visits to the doctor for ongoing and complex care management. Women have a 
higher likelihood than men of having one or more chronic health conditions . As demand 
for and utilisation of health  care increases, so do out -of-pocket costs, which t hen have a 
greater impact on women overall. Women ’s out -of-pocket medical costs are 
disproportionately higher than for men at  every age grouping from 19 to 64,36 in turn 
creating barriers to care and worsening disease burden.  
The Government is committed to improving primary health  care for Australians with its 
investments towards Strengthening Medicare over the past three years. In addition to 
targeted investments in women ’s health, new investments in bulk billing, Medicare Urgent 
Care Clinics, the primary care workforce and reducing the costs of medicines will improve 
the access and affordability of care for all Australians, with increased benefits for women 
with greater ne ed for health services and medicines.  
Improving the access and affordability of primary care and medicines  
As the first point of contact in the healthcare system, seeing a GP is crucial for women, 
ensuring they receive comprehensive care, regular screenings, and continuous 
management of chronic conditions. Through the Government ’s Strengthening Medicare 
package, expanded bulk billing incentive eligibility and other incentives will mean that 
nine out of ten GP visits are expected to be bulk billed by 2030. A boost to bulk billing rates 
is a boost to women ’s health outcomes, enabling more Australians to access ess ential 
medical care for free, without the financial burden of out -of-pocket expenses. In 2023 –24, 
women spen t around $331 million more than men on GP services.  Given women ’s higher 
demand for and use of GP services and bulk billing, women are likely to see greater cost 
savings as a group.

Page 66 | Health  
Gender analysis in practice: Bulk billing for all Australians  
In line with Working for Women  and the National Women ’s Health Strategy 2020 –2030,  
this Government initiative expands access to affordable primary care. While 
benefiting all Medicare patients, it is likely to have a greater positive impact on 
women, who face higher health  care demands and barriers to access.  
2023 –2024 Medica re Benefits Schedule data shows that women are:  
• more likely to access GP services, including for chronic conditions: 11. 9 million 
women accessed GP services ( 2.5 million for chronic GP services) compared to 
10.6 million men ( 1.9 million for chronic GP services)  
• accessing more services in total: 95  million services (including 6.3 million chronic 
disease services) compared to  69 million services (including 4.8 million chronic 
disease services) for men, but women are bulk billed less frequently across 
GP services.  
Diverse groups often face even greater needs and barriers, due to factors such as 
limited educational opportunities, cultural norms, and logistical, financial and 
language barriers.37 For example:  
• First Nations women have more chronic conditions (for example, asthma, 
arthritis, diabetes, osteoporosis and kidney disease)  
• some women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds have greater 
risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and mental illness, and lower rates of 
accessing health  care and preventative care  
• women in rural, regional and remote areas have worse access to health  care due 
to geographic spread, infrastructure gaps, low population density, and higher 
service delivery costs.  
Under the Government ’s new bulk billing initiatives, Medicare rebates for a 
standard GP consult ation  for a non -concessional adult  at a practice participating in 
the Bulk Billing Practice Incentive Program will increase by 62  per cent in metro 
areas, 88  per cent in regional centres , 98 per cent in small rural towns  and 
103 per cent in remote areas .  
In addition to  ongoing  care from their GP , women also need access to free, high -quality 
urgent care when and where it  is needed . Medicare Urgent Care Clinics continue to 
provide crucial health  care support for Australians, particularly for women and families, 
by offering timely care without out -of-pocket expenses  while also avoiding hospitals and 
emergency departments . Uptake of Medicare Urgent Care Clinics services remains high – 
since June  2023, there have been more than 1. 3 million visits to the Government ’s existing 
87 Clinics, with women making up approximately 55  per cent of visits. In this Budget, the 
Government is providing funding to expand the Medicare Urgent Care Clinics program , 
with an additional 50 clinics across Australia, taking the total number of clinics to 
137 Austra lia-wide.   Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Health  | Page 67 
The cost of medicines remains another significant health  care barrier for women. Just as 
women are typically higher users of health services, they also tend to use more medic ines, 
especially for managing reproductive health or chronic conditions. For example, among 
individuals aged 25 –34, 68.3  per cent of women and 44.1  per cent of men received 
prescriptions.38 To further ease cost-of-living pressures and improve access to necessary 
treatments for Australians and women, lowering of the PBS general patient co -payment 
will reduce out -of-pocket costs for each script dispensed. The reduced PBS co -payment will 
make a meaningful difference for women by bringing down the cost of their medicines , 
including ongoing medication for conditions such as endometriosis, menopause and 
osteoporosis, or contraception. For general patients with a m onthly prescription filled at the 
maximum price, a patient will save $79.20 a year. Families filling four prescriptions a 
month will save as much as $316.80 .

Strengthening Medicare: improving access to affordable health  care 
The Government is committing a further $7.9  billion over four years from 2025 –26 to 
support access to affordable primary care and provide more bulk billing for all 
Australians. This includes:  
• expanding eligibility for bulk billing incentives to cover all Australians  
• establishing the Bulk Billing Practice Incentive Program to provide incentives to 
practices across Australia that choose to become fully bulk billing practices.  
The Government is providing $644  million over three  years from 2025 –26 to 
establish 50 additional Medicare Urgent Care Clinics across the country to make 
health  care more accessible and convenient for Australians and to help to reduce 
pressure on hospitals and emergency departments. The addition of 50  new clinics 
means that 80  per cent of Australians will live within a 20 -minute drive of a clinic . 
Cheaper medicines  
The Government is making medicines cheaper  by committing $784.6  million over 
four years from 2025 –26 to reduce the general patient co -payment under  the PBS 
from $31.60 to $25.00 from  1 January  2026. Each year, this will benefit more than five 
million Australians, cumulatively saving more than $200 million in 
out-of-pocket  costs.

Ensuring coordinated and culturally appropriate care  
Also critical to women ’s access to and experience of quality care is how it is coordinated. 
For women, including women from diverse groups, navigating the healthcare system can 
be complex. The 2022 Strengthening Medicare Taskforce Report  highlights that despite 
Australia having some of the world ’s best health professionals, the organisation and 
funding of health services can be disjointed. In 2023 –24, 18 per cent of Australians saw 
three or more different health professionals for the same condition. This ca n decrease 
engagement with the health system and impact women, who have higher rates of chronic 
and complex conditions.  
Investment in better care coordination will enhance critical early intervention, diagnosis, 
treatment, management of long -term conditions and health promotion and prevention 
services for all Australians, including women. Culturally safe health  care continues to be 
delivered in partnership with communities through the Health in My Language (HiML) 
Program, which has reached over 40,000  migrant and refugee women, and the Deadly 
Choices Program, enabling additional health checks on key risk areas for First Nati ons 
people. These programs demonstrate how the Government is supporting women from 
diverse groups to access multidisciplinary care tailored to their health, cultural and 
language needs by ensuring they are community -led initiatives, in partnership with 
Primary Health Networks.  
Budget highlights: Enhancing access to coordinated health care  
First Nations health care  
The Government is investing to close the gap by improving health assessments and 
detection for First Nations Australians. This includes funding for improved 
detection, monitoring and management of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic 
heart disease in First Nations communities, and support for more First Nations 
Australians to access health assessments through the Deadly Choices Program. The 
Government is also providing funding for hearing and oral health services in remote 
communities as part of the Northern Territory Remote Aboriginal Investment.  
The Government is also funding complementary measures, including investing 
$21.4  million over three years from 2025 –26 to build a nutrition workforce in remote 
communities through upskilling local First Nations staff in up to 106  remote stores to 
provide nutritional advice. The Government is also providing $11.4  million over 
four years from 2025 –26 to support the reduction of preventable illness by 
establishing or upgrading up to 12  community laundries in remote First Nations 
communities across northern and  central Australia .

MYEFO highlights: Enhancing health care access for culturally and 
linguistically diverse women and  LGBTIQA+  people  
The Government is providing a further $5.4  million in 2025 –26 for the Health in My 
Language (HiML) program, bringing total investment across 2021 –22 to 2025 –26 to 
$24.3 million. Funding will extend delivery of the HiML program that enables 
migrant and refugee women to discuss important health issues in their own 
language.  
Delivered in partnership with local culturally and linguistically diverse 
communities, the HiML program initially focused on COVID -19 vaccinations but has 
since expanded to cover sexual and reproductive health topics.  
Providing health information and education in diverse languages ensures that 
practitioners can better address the various health needs of women across Australia.  
To support the implementation of the 10 ‑Year National Action Plan for the Health 
and Wellbeing of LGBTIQA+ people, the Government has invested $15.5  million 
over four years from 2024 –25 to kick -start system -wide improvements, including:  
• establishing a $13. 1 million grants program to scale up dedicated LGBTIQA+ 
services and support successful initiatives that build the health and wellbeing of 
LGBTIQA+ communities  
• investing $2.0  million to collect data to underpin priority areas for action through 
La Trobe University ’s ‘Private Lives ’ and ‘Writing Themselves In ’ health and 
wellbeing surveys  
• providing $ 0.5 million  to expand InterAction for Health and Human Rights 
InterLink program, a community -led professional psychosocial support service 
for people with innate variations of sex characteristics . Women's Budget Statement  |

Leadership, representation and 
decision -making  
Key statistics  
In the 47th Parliament, women make 
up 39.6% of the House of 
Representatives and 57.9% 
of the Senate  11 of 2 3 Cabinet positions are 
held by women39 
Women hold 54.4% of Australian 
Government board positions  40.6% of managers across the 
labour  force are women  
Women o nly hold  9% of CEO  roles  
and 30% of executive leadership 
roles  in the ASX300  In 2022 , only 5.7% of board directors  
were  culturally diverse women , 
despite women comprising 46%  
of board directors40 
Achieving  gender equality  means  women from a range of backgrounds meaningfully 
participat ing in decision -making and public life – in communities, sport, art and culture, 
education, businesses, and government. Representative leadership ensures institutions, 
systems and services achieve better outcomes, not only for women, but for everyone . While 
there is strong progress in many sectors, there is more to do to address barriers to women ’s 
leadership and representation in Australia.   
Women in Australia have been historically under -represented in leadership and 
decision -making structures, contributing to the gender gaps present today. This is more 
pronounced  for First Nations  women and women from diverse backgrounds, who face 
greater barriers to representation and career progression due to compounding forms of 
discrimination such as racism and sexism.  
The Government is driving  action to increase women ’s representation across all levels of 
leadership and decision -making, in line with Working for Women . This includes supporting 
representation in sport to ensure women and girls can fully and equitably participate and 
see role models in all aspects of community life.   
 
 | Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 72 | Leadership, representation and decision -making  
Women in leadership and decision -making  
The Government is leading by example within the Australian Parliament, 
Australian  Government boards, and the Australian Public Service, to improve women ’s 
leadership and meaningful participation in decision making. A critical part of this is 
ensuring more First  Nations women, women with disability and women from diverse 
backgrounds are represented in decision -making and leadership positions.  
Women in parliament  
Since 1901, only 8.3  per cent of Cabinet members have been women , but recent 
development s demonstrate significant progress .41 The Government is the first gender equal 
federal government in Australia ’s history, and in January  2025, Federal Cabinet achieved 
gender parity for the first time  (excluding the Prime Minister) . In addition, the  
47th Parliament is the most gender -equal on record in Australia , with women making up 
45.8 per cent of parliamentarians (as at  February  2025), representing a 9.2  per cent increase 
since the opening of the 46th Parliament.   
Women in leadership  
The Government reached  record representation of women on Australian  Government 
boards in 2023 –24, with women holding 54.4  per cent of all positions and 45.3  per cent 
of Chair and Deputy Chair positions.42 These are the highest overall results since reporting 
began in 2009 and demonstrates the value of setting targets. To drive more consistent  
progress across all portfolios, in March 202 4 the Government set new portfolio -level  targets 
for women to hold 50  per cent of board positions and Chair and Deputy chair positions on 
Government boards .  
Meanwhile, progress towards gender equality in the private sector has been less positive . 
91 per cent of ASX300 CEO positions are held by men and the number of women being 
appointed as CEOs is decreasing.43 This reflects women ’s under representation in CEO 
pipeline roles, such as Managing Director, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer, with men holding 82  per cent of these positions  and an increasing number of  
companies with no women in these roles.  
High -paid executive roles, where women are most under -represented, contribute 
significantly to the gender pay gap.  The 2023 –24 WGEA gender pay gap data for the first 
time  includes CEO and Head of Business remuneration , and shows this category has the 
largest pay gap of all manager categories, at 27.1  per cent.

Including women ’s voices and experiences in decision -making  
The Government is continuing to listen and respond to women from diverse backgrounds 
to inform policymaking and program delivery. The Working for Women Program funds 
partnerships to support engaging with women and the community and including their 
experien ces in decision -making. The program aims to improve outcomes for women and 
gender equality in Australia and will support evidence -based projects that drive change for 
all women.  
In the  first year of the program, the Government has established two key partnerships. 
In October  2024, the Government announced it will provide $10.9  million from 
2024 –25 to 2028 –29 to partner with the National Women ’s Alliances to ensure women ’s 
voices and expertise inform the implementation of Working for Women . In February  2025, 
the Government announced a research partnership with the University of Sydney, 
providing  $5.0 million from 2024 –25 to 2029 –30 to help build the evidence base on what 
works to achieve gender equality. This will  draw on women ’s experiences to  identify 
practical solutions for government, industry, and community action to improve gender 
equality, with a focus on economic outcomes.  
Supporting  First Nations women in leadership and decision -making  
Listening to First  Nations women and girls is integral to gender equality and implementing 
the National Agreement on Closing the Gap . The  Wiyi  Yani U Thangani  report brings 
together the voices of First  Nations women and girls as a collective on issues that matter to 
them, such as leadership and decision -making. Empowering women ’s leadership on 
the ground is one of the report ’s seven recommendations. In  March  2024, the 
Wiyi  Yani  U Thangani  Institute for First  Nations Gender Justice and Equality was launched 
to see through the report ’s recommendations and continue working towards equality for 
First  Nations women. The Institute ’s Change Agenda, also published in  March  2024, 
provides a framework to guide the Institute, community, public and private stakeholders. 
The Change Agenda outlines that the Institute will bring together First  Nations researchers 
to design systemic change initiatives to improve life outcomes and deliver lasting change 
for First  Nations women and girls.  
Including First  Nations women ’s voices in leadership and decision -making is relevant 
across a broad range of government activities and can have wide -ranging positive impacts. 
For instance, Government  initiatives are supporting women ’s participation in Australia ’s 
clean energy transition, including for First  Nations women, through measures that 
encourage women to take on leadership roles in energy development.   
 
 | Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 74 | Leadership, representation and decision -making  
Gender analysis in practice: First  Nations Clean Energy Implementation 
and Grants Programs  
The inaugural First  Nations Clean Energy Strategy is embedding First  Nations 
expertise in the clean energy transition. In the 2024 –25 MYEFO, Government 
provided $70.0  million over three years from 2025 –26 to establish the First  Nations 
Clean Energy Futures Implementation and Grants Programs, which will reduce 
barriers to accessing clean energy for First  Nations communities and support new 
First  Nations led clean energy projects. This measure aims to advance gender 
equality by supporting First  Nations women to take on leadership roles and 
self-determine how they participate in, and benefit from, Australia ’s clean energy 
transition.  
Nationally, women are under -represented in the clean energy workforce, with men 
representing 65  per cent of workforce. First  Nations people are also 
under -represented in this sector with employment at 1.9  per cent, however, further 
gender -disaggregated data is limited. Consequently, gender analysis for this 
measure relied on broader data relating to First  Nations peoples and identifying 
areas to support First  Nations women to take advantage of the clean energy 
transition.  
This measure will help to mitigate skills shortages , support participation in clean 
energy projects and create new economic opportunities for First  Nations women, 
such as jobs, business ownership, and community development initiatives. It will 
also provide First  Nations communities with accessible clean energy for essential 
needs, contributing to quality -of-life outcomes for both men and women.  
Small business  ownership is an area where  First Nations women  are significantly 
under -represented, making  up only 0.4  per cent of all small business owners and 
36.1 per cent of First Nations small business owners  in Australia . First Nations women face 
unique barriers when establish ing or grow ing their enterprises, including difficulties 
interacting with financial institutions and exclusion due to racism , sexism  and cultural 
discrimination . This Budget includes funding to help address the barriers facing 
First  Nations businesswomen and entrepreneurs , in line with Outcome  8 of the National 
Agreement on Closing the Gap  for strong  economic participation and development of 
First  Nations people and their communities . Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Leadership, representation and decision -making  | Page 75 
Budget highlight: Supporting First Nations women in business  
The Government is providing $3.4  million over three years from 2025 –26 to establish 
a place -based business mentoring and coaching program. This program will provide 
First Nations women with greater access to the resources, networks and support 
they need to launch a viable business, commercialise a viable business idea or grow 
an existing business. The measure will provide up to six m onths of individualised 
coaching sessions for up to 75  First Nations women in both 2026 –27 and 2027 –28. 
This measure will help  create the foundation for business and economic 
opportunities, particularly in regional and remote areas.  
Women ’s and girls ’ representation and participation in sport  
Sport is a powerful vehicle for driving positive societal and economic change, with benefits 
for individuals, communities, and society. The profile and status of women ’s sport is rising 
fast, with an expansion of national competitions, more community recognition of female 
sport stars and their achievements , and increased media coverage. Australia recorded its 
best result at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, where women  and mixed teams  won 13 of 
Australia ’s 18 gold medals and 32 of Australia ’s 53 medals overall across a range of 
individual and team sports. Australian women finished third in the national women ’s 
medal tally. At  the Paris  2024 Paralympics, Australia finished in ninth place on the medal 
tally with women and mixed teams winning 10 of Australia ’s 18 gold medals and 2 9 of 
Australia ’s 63 medals.   
In September  2024, the Minister for Sport and the Australian Sports Commission Chair 
launched the National Gender Equity in Sport Governance Policy to help address the 
underrepresentation of women in sports leadership. The national policy is the first of its 
kind in Australia and is a collaboration between the Australian S ports Commission and 
state and territory sport and recreation agencies. The policy includes a set of gender targets 
for the Australian sport sector backed by funding incentives, including for women to make 
up 50  per cent of all board directors, board chair s and specified board sub -committee 
members.  
While there has been significant progress in women ’s sport, there continues to be a gender 
gap in sport participation . In 2022 –23, 32  per cent of women aged 15 and over participated 
in a sport -related activity at least once a week, compared to 48  per cent of men. Women are 
also under -represented in coaching and sports administration. The Government is 
supporting a diverse and equitable sporting system through various measures designed to 
empower women to thrive at all levels of sport.  
In August  2023, the Government announced the Play Our Way program , an investment of  
$200.0  million over four years from 2023 –24 to address sport participation barriers faced 
by women and girls. The competitive  grant program, run in early  2024 , attracted over  
1,600  applications from sporting clubs, not -for-profits, community organisations and local 
governments, demonstrating demand to better support  women ’s participation in sport.  
 
 | Women's Budget Statement  
 
Page 76 | Leadership, representation and decision -making  
Around  290 organisations across Australia have received, or will receive , funding under 
the program, including $136 .0 million  to approximately  165 organisations for facilities 
grants, and $55.8 million to approximately  125 organisations for participation and 
equipment grants.  Funding commenced in  October  2024, with projects to be completed 
by mid–2027.   
In October  2024, the Government launched the new National Sport Strategy, Sport Horizon , 
which sets the priori ties for sport in Australia over the next decade . The strategy promotes 
participation, inclusion and safety  so that everyone, including women and girls, can benefit 
from the health, social , and economic benefits of sport.   
MYEFO highlights: Supporting women ’s leadership and participation 
in sport  
• The Government is providing $3.2  million in 2025 –26 to support women and 
girls ’ participation in coaching, officiating and sports administration. This 
includes a $1.1  million investment to extend the Women Leaders in Sport 
program, which provides women with opportunities to advance their leadership 
journey through development program s and training initiatives. The funding 
also extends support for the National Generation 2032 Coach Program, which 
aims to increase the number and diversity of Australian high p erformance career 
coaches. The program provides direct employment for coaches within high 
performance sport under the supervision of a technical coach and child care 
support and flexible working arrangements for coaches with children.  
• The Government is investing $15.0  million over two years from 2024 –25 to 
support the delivery of the 2026 Women ’s Asian Cup in Australia. This event will 
capitalise on the growth seen in women ’s sport after the 2023 FIFA Women ’s 
World Cup and supports the Government ’s focus on increasing opportunities for 
women and girls in  sport.  
 
Building gender equality capability across government  
The Government is uplifting gender equality capability across the Australian Public Service  
to ensure comprehensive gender analysis informs decision -making and drives progress 
towards the vision of Working for Women.  Gender responsive budgeting was reintroduced 
in the  2022 –23 October  Budget to highlight the  impacts policies have on Australian women 
and men . This is the second Women ’s Budget Statement to include case studies of gender 
analysis in practice, which show how these processes inform policy.  
In the  2022 –23 October and 2023 –24 Budgets, Gender Impact Assessment pilots were 
undertaken on a select number of high priority proposals. Since the 2023 –24 MYEFO, the 
Budget Process Operational Rules require all departments drafting Cabinet Submissions 
and New Policy Pr oposals to undertake gender analysis. Proposals that meet set criteria Women's Budget Statement  |  
 
Leadership, representation and decision -making  | Page 77 
require a more detailed Gender Impact Assessment to ensure decision makers receive 
accurate and evidence -based advice on the gender impacts of policy decisions. The criteria 
target policy areas with the most opportunity to address inequality. For example, one 
criterion requires a Gender Impact Assessment on proposals related to gender segregated 
industries, w hich are key drivers of Australia ’s gender pay gap. This targeted approach to 
gender responsive budgeting ensures efforts to conduct gender analysis ar e proportional to 
the policy ’s potential impact, value, and scope.  
The Office for Women embeds gender responsive budgeting into budget processes and 
oversees implementation across the Australian Public Service . The Office for Women 
provides a range of resources on gender responsive budgeting, such as the updated 
Including Gender: An APS Guide to Gender Analysis and Gender Impact Assessment , released 
in January  2025.  
Recent progress has also been made to improve gender -disaggregated data within 
Government. This includes more accurate reporting on occupations, which helps to better 
understand gender composition (and therefore gender gaps) in different sectors. 
In December  2024, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released  the Occupation Standard 
Classification for Australia (OSCA), providing an improved framework for reporting 
occupation -related information. OSCA has improved identification of female -dominated 
occupation s, which previously did not reflect the number of people or different roles within 
occupations. For example, the occupation ‘welfare worker ’ has been further disaggregated 
to recognise differences in child protection, mental health and the family, domestic and 
sexual violence workforce. Changes like this will support labour market analysis on gender 
equality and more accurate reporting on fema le-dominated occupations. OSCA will be 
used in employment data from the 2026 Census (due to be published in  October  2027).  
Global leadership on gender equality  
Australia ’s international gender equality strategy  
The Government is providing global leadership on gender equality. In  February  2025, the 
Government released Australia ’s International Gender Equality Strategy: For a safer, more 
prosperous Indo Pacific and World . This strategy places gender equality at the centre of 
international engagement and builds on Australia ’s proud legacy as a global leader and 
trusted partner on gender equality. The  strategy  elevates efforts in support of women ’s 
health, rights and safety, gender equitable climate action, and locally led approaches to 
women ’s leadership and women ’s economic equality. It highlights the importance of 
partnerships with partner governments, civil society and the international community.  
Australia is committed to meeting the target that 80  per cent of development investments 
are implemented in a way that effectively supports gender equality. In 2023 –24, 79  per cent 
of Australia ’s development investments effectively addressed gender equality. 
The Government also implemented a new requirement for development and humanitarian 
investments valued at $3.0  million and above to have a gender equality objective , driving 
an increase in expenditure on gender equality. In  2023 –24, Australia invested $2 .3 billion in 
development programs that targeted gender equality, up from $1.5  billion in 2021 –22.

Page 78 | Leadership, representation and decision -making  
Advancing human rights and gender equality  
The Government is working collaboratively with states to secure fundamental human 
rights for women and girls. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women is an important international instrument enshrining 
women ’s human rights and advancing gender equality.  
In February  2025, Australia submitted its ninth periodic report on measures taken to 
advance gender equality as part of Australia ’s reporting obligation to the United Nations 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (the Committee). The 
periodic report highlights the significant reforms Australia has made since the last report in 
2016 including releasing Australia ’s first gender equality strategy, Working for Women , and 
progress on women ’s representation in parliament. The Government also supported the 
successful  re-election of Natasha Stott Despoja AO to the Committee for the 2025 –28 term  
to continue Australia ’s global leadership in advancing women ’s and girls ’ rights.   
The United Nations Commission on the Status of Women  
The Commission on the Status of Women is the premier global forum on gender policy 
issues, that provides an opportunity to highlight Australia ’s achievements, while listening, 
learning and reflecting upon the work of other member states. The sixty -ninth session of 
the Commission  (CSW69), from 10 to 21  March  2025, focused on the review and appraisal 
of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (Beijing+30). In  July 2024, Australia 
submitted its report on the implementation of Beijing+30, which reflects  Australia ’s 
positive journey towards achieving gender equality over the last five years since the 
previous report. Australia ’s report fed into a regional and global review of implementation 
presented at CSW69, identifying key areas for accelerated action to achieving gender 
equality as outlined in the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.
